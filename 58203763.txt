Okay keep calm, deep breaths, you got this!’</p><p>The warmth was surprisingly malleable, it only took her a few moments but she began her trusty multiple steps compression method.</p><p>‘Throw the warmth into the pot to boil it down… fold it like a cloth, squeeze it by sitting on the bag, put it in the box… Wait, somehow it's becoming less? YES! Take it away please! Urgh…</p><p>The mother of all headaches hit her like Vulcanift’s hammer. And there were voices now too!</p><p>“Our La...ia Shield! Praise the...”</p><p>Her head was killing her. At least the heat was just a warm tingling now.</p><p>‘Don’t yell please. Ugh I just feel awful now.’</p><p>Wait. Did someone just drain her mana from her? Did it work? After all the suffering she endured, she sure hoped it did.</p><p>The darkness began to recede and after much struggling she could open her eyes somewhat. She was in a comfortable bed, the sun shone through the see through curtains of a window on her left side. The room was moderately furnished as far as she could tell, so no commoner household then but everything was white? At her bedside sat a vaguely familiar, young Woman with Aubergine hair and gray eyes that were looking down at her with a worried smile on her lips. Her gray robes indicated her as a Grey shrine maiden. The Temple?!</p><p>“Um…?”</p><p>“My Lady, I am glad you finally woke up. We were most worried after the fever robbed you of Dauerleben’s divine protection.”</p><p>Now hold on a minute here! Did she get this right? She was prone to fevers? Again? NO! She vehemently insisted on this point specifically! A healthy Body and no sickness this time! Were they already renouncing their word? Was this the worth of their promises? And why the Temple?!</p><p>‘This was not what we agreed on!’</p><p>The still somewhat familiar woman spoke again. “I did send the rest of the attendants from the room to give you space. How are you feeling?”</p><p>Well she had attendants so it seems like she was at least a noble daughter this time. At least this clueless bunch of gods got something right. No worrying about being a commoner in noble society this time. Progress!</p><p>‘Still… I will miss my old family. I did insist on this but they are strangers now so I will not see them in the same way ever again. At least they are safer now. Why the temple though? She said attendants so I am a blue shrine maiden again?</p><p>Even more questions. The number keeps on growing but the woman looked at her with worried eyes and a slight frown now. Oops.</p><p>“My head hurts, and I am feeling so weak...What happened?”</p><p>The frown deepened slightly.</p><p>“My Lady, you collapsed two days ago on the way back to your chambers. I am glad you seem to have recovered somewhat at last.”</p><p>As if finishing her sentence, the door to the room opened and another gray shrine maiden came a few steps inside. She had blue eyes and her chestnut coloured hair swayed slightly to the side as she asked a question. It was a younger Rosina!</p><p>“Jenni, has our young mistress finally awoken?”</p><p>“Yes, she has. I do remember I sent all of you out to not overwhelm her as that occurred, did something happen?”</p><p>The now named Jenni retorted with obvious exasperation directed at her favorite musician. The name finally kickstarted her memory of who the woman at her bedside was too.</p><p>‘Jenni? Oh! She was also a shrine maiden employed by Christine before! It was so long ago now, but she was the one who deceived Delia and had resented Wilma and Rosina because only she had to serve the mean High Bishop.</p><p>The memory of Jenni restraining her as Myne for Bezewanst and Count Bindewald to force the signing of a subjugation Contract nearly made her shudder. Rosina's answer brought her back to current matters though.</p><p>“Yes, the High Bishop sent Delia to inquire of our Lady’s current condition as the Dedication Ritual is beginning in four days.”</p><p>“I see, my apologies then. Tell them her fever has abated and we will send word once she has recovered properly. Is that alright my Lady?”</p><p>With the last sentence Jenni’s focus shifted to her again, awaiting her answer.</p><p>“Yes I see no problem with this. Do as she said, also send a word to prepare a meal for me.”</p><p>“At once my Lady.”</p><p>Rosina crossed her arms in a bow and left my new room to fulfill her new directions, closing the door behind her softly. After Rosina’s departure she focused her attention back at Jenni.</p><p>“As I was trapped in Schlaftraum’s Realm you did not get your Divine gifts either did you? Please ensure that everyone gets their share after I eat.”</p><p>Jenni’s expression softened.</p><p>“You are too kind my Lady, please do not think of it, we are honored to serve you. Please rest now. I will wake you when the meal arrives.”</p><p>And so she laid back in her mattress and let sleep claim her once more, her mind drifting away.</p><p>‘I am really hungry now. Wait...I have a bad feeling I forgot something?.’</p>

    <p>‘I am getting a serious case of déjà-vu here.’</p><p>Not a moment after she drifted to sleep her mind was assaulted with memories of the life of a five year old. Again! And just like before it began to merge with her old memories.</p><p>It was becoming a sort of routine at this point, strange as it is. But the best news was something she could not suppress her hype about.</p><p>‘I feared the worst at first but… I am healthy! I can walk and even run without collapsing! Oh sweet freedom of movement! This fever seems to be the first time I ever got something like this here.’</p><p>Seems like it was just some kind of requirement for her reincarnation. She could forgive those clueless gods for that at least she supposed. Barely.</p><p>“My Lady please wake up.”</p><p>And just like that she was taken from her... mind meld? Sure, let's call it that! As Jenni woke her up and the smell of food reached her nose, her premonition became cruel reality as her eyes landed on the meal. As she began to eat she had to suppress a groan.</p><p>‘The food is so bland. This is a crime against Cuococalura! Oh no, I have to change that. Again. Curses!’</p><p>There really was no changing it for now so she simply endured and ate without complaint. It helped a great deal that she was so hungry to begin with. The plate was finished at a rapid pace. Jenni chastised her softly afterwards.</p><p>“It seems the incident did not diminish your appetite at all my Lady. I understand that you are hungry but there is no need to rush. Do you want another portion?”</p><p>“Yes Jenni, and no more please that was quite enough thank you. You may take the rest to the others now.”</p><p>“Of course, I believe it would be best if you try to sleep for the rest of the day to recover.”</p><p>She laid back and followed the advice, Sleep claiming her soon after. The next morning arrived and with it the first real steps into this new life began.</p><p>‘Can I really call it that? This is like what, my third or fourth time if my end as Myne and start as Rozemyne counts. It is kind of funny I am Rozemyne from the start this time, I even look the same! Did the gods just copy and paste me into this life like the spell I created? At least I am a little bit taller and not short for my age this time!’</p><p>As funny as this thought was, it was better if she averted that potential existential crisis. She had enough on her plate already. Food was in desperate need of improvement and if the morning preparations she got through were any indicator Rinsham was on this list too.</p><p>The Artistic Trio consisting of Rosina, Wilma and Jenni as her Head attendant were serving her currently. After bathing she got an aromatic oil massage for her sore body. Afterwards it was dressing time before joining her new old life at the Temple as an apprentice blue shrine maiden.</p><p>So after breakfast she called her attendants together and it was time to organize the return of her quality of life. Namely the food! She smiled her best Lady’s smile and began.</p><p>“Jenni, just to make sure, I can send someone to the commoner district to order something or give instructions right?”</p><p>“Yes my Lady, of course you can. But what would you possibly want from there?”</p><p>Her smile only got wider. Oh if only they knew how she planned to exploit this little loophole in the rules they would be appalled. Time for work!</p><p>“Good, do we have a list of available shops for clothing? I want to discuss something with one. If not, send Word to the Merchant Guild Master to inquire about possible candidates.”</p><p>My new instructions clearly confused my attendants as Wilma timidly spoke up next.</p><p>“But my Lady, the Dedication Ritual is just in three days. Won’t you be busy this time?”</p><p>“I can meet with them after my participation, it does not take the whole day. I can only supply so much until I need to recuperate for the next one after all.</p><p>Regarding the Dedication Ritual, I remember the High Bishop asking for my ability to participate. Please send word to assure him I received the blessings of Heilschmerz once again.</p><p>Also I can see in your faces you all are confused. You may ask your questions one at a time now.”</p><p>It was Jenni that voiced her question first this time.</p><p>“My Lady, it is just... I am afraid we are under Verbergen's shroud as to what you wish to achieve with this request. It is as if you were emboldened by Steifebrise. Please grant us Anhaltung's blessing so that we may better serve you.”</p><p>“It may be hard to believe, but the Gods spoke to me as I collapsed. It is Anhaltung herself who graced me with visions of what I must do, and as a blue shrine maiden, I will humbly follow her guidance from now on. First, I must embody Flutrane to tempt Greifechan’s favor to us. For that I need the Goddess' most devoted and their connections.”</p><p>It was only natural for them to raise a few eyebrows at her blatant statement that she was receiving messages from the gods directly. Well she did, just not for this but whatever. She would make her food good again dammit!</p><p>Additionally she was an abandoned child this time. A true apprentice blue shrine maiden. What better way to rejoin noble society than stroke their greed for her future trends if not her fortune or mana? Win-Win.</p><p>‘I need to know my mana capacity in this body too. After my lessons I need to visit the divine instruments to check without witnesses. So much to do so little time. Bah, Greifechan favors the bold!’</p><p>After the meeting it was time for her lessons. Her sudden easy grasp on all matters excluding noble euphemisms throwing her attendants for a loop and only fortifying her godly blessing rhetoric.</p><p>‘I was called a saint last time, even if I opposed it to my last breath. Not to mention that I’m actually on a mission from the gods so it’s hardly just propaganda now. It is a new start so why not embrace it this time if it’s inevitable? More tools won’t hurt me.’</p><p>With her lessons now over she sent Rosina to check if the air was clear at the divine instruments. After confirming no one was still there she made her way to the altar. She arrived and no one was there. Good. Moment of truth then.</p><p>As she prepared to send her mana into Schutzaria’s Shield she loosened her compression and watched the magic circle appear, followed with the feystones on it lighting up one after the other after touching the instrument.</p><p>‘Hm a little bit more than I expected. I would guess that is Arch noble level at least. Hartmut produced one stone less after his appointment as High Priest. So mana at least will not be a problem. Speaking of, I wonder how many aptitudes and blessings I have now. And wait...How did my mana go away as I had the fever?’</p><p>So many questions. Letting go of the shield Rozemyne looked around and there was still no one around except her attendants. She made her way back to her chambers to check the list of available lower city contacts. But of course it could not be so easy, as shortly after her return a messenger arrived.</p><p>“Sister Rozemyne, Delia is back. The High Bishop asks for a meeting at the first possible opportunity.”</p><p>‘Of course he does...’</p>

    <p>The sudden meeting with the High Bishop was to be in two days time, the day before the start of the Dedication Ritual. In the meantime Jenni brought forth the list of possible clothing merchants and luckily the Gilberta company was prominently listed. After checking the list two times for appearance’s sake she gave her orders.</p><p>“I have decided, please send word to the Gilberta Company to send a representative at the next best opportunity. I do not know how the timetable for the Dedication Ritual works yet, so please wait until after the first day.”</p><p>“Of course my Lady, as you wish.”</p><p>“Ah I nearly forgot. What did you do as I had the fever? I felt some of the heat vanish, it was a great relief.”</p><p>Somehow her question made her present attendants really uncomfortable. Except, why did Wilma look kinda proud now?</p><p>“After the first shock of your collapse wore off. We looked into possible reasons and it was Wilma who brought up that you didn't dedicate your mana to the gods in preparation for the upcoming ritual.</p><p>After gaining permission, we tried to use the shield of her holiness Lady Schutzaria to drain some of it. After absorbing your mana you awoke not soon after, much to our relief.”</p><p>Well that certainly answered that question. After reassuring them it was not their fault and praising Wilma for her quick thinking she was practically glowing with pride now. It seems even in this new life her attendants are still excellent.</p><p>With the most important stuff in reach cleared, it was time to face her hardest battle after her return. Meeting the High Bishop. If her new memories could be trusted this would be her strangest meeting with the fake Santa yet. How fun.</p><p>Two days later at third bell she walked into the High Bishops chambers for the meeting. The fake Santa was smiling his usual fake benevolent smile as both gave their greetings.</p><p>“Ah little Rozemyne I am glad Heilschmerz’s blessing has returned to you. I hope you are prepared for the Ritual tomorrow, it is your first time participating after all if I remember correctly.”</p><p>“Of course High Bishop, I am happy to finally help nourish our Geduldh. I will do my best.”</p><p>She gave her best sweet smile coupled with the innocence only a child could possibly get away with. The fake smile broadened slightly as he spoke again.</p><p>“Good. Good. And do not worry, as it will be your first participation, I will personally oversee and guide you on the first day. It would normally fall to the High Priest to do this but who could possibly entrust such a bright young child like you to that man.”</p><p>The last part was said with enough contempt it nearly made her want to roll her eyes, would it not be for her past noble training. Truly rich coming from him, talking about entrusting children to someone. But she made a troubled face after he finished.</p><p>“The High Priest? I have never met him personally. My attendants said he sent word that I have some lessons scheduled with him two days after the end of the Dedication Ritual. Is he not trustworthy?”</p><p>“Lessons, hmm.”</p><p>The High Bishop took his time after her reply to think things over. After a while he eyed her with his fake smile gone, a worried frown taking its place.</p><p>“No need to worry, that man would never care to lay a hand on you, or any girl or woman for that matter, especially as you are under my protection. But do not trust him, he sought the temple as a refuge from his enemies.</p><p>He does not understand our plight in the least, everything is a means to an end for him. But all this gives us an opportunity. Tell me little Rozemyne, would you be willing to do me a favor? For us all?”</p><p>“A favor, High Bishop? What do you require?”</p><p>“Attend his lesson and report afterwards directly to me. He has long since reduced the eyes on him wherever he could. I fear what he could possibly be planning. Could you do this for me, Rozemyne?”</p><p>‘So he wants to use me to spy on Ferdinand because all his old spies got removed? Really? I’m a child. How desperate can you get? On the other hand this is truly an opportunity.’</p><p>“I see no problem with it, High Bishop, but can I ask to get access to the book room in exchange? The book you lent to me at our last meeting was truly a gift from the gods.”</p><p>The High Bishop was slightly taken by surprise at her counteroffer. Followed by chuckling loudly, his smile returning and now somehow looking genuine. What?</p><p>“You already finished it? Very well, I see no need to use your favor for this. Of course I shall grant you access to Mestionora’s splendor. It is the least I can do to nourish a young and eager mind like yours. Think nothing of it.”</p><p>‘Bwuh?! Did...did the fake Santa just become a real one? I can read books in the book room for free? Really?! Praise be to the gods!’</p><p>She really needed to up her compression before a blessing escaped her this time. Her eyes sparkling at her fortune. The High Bishop’s response was another chuckle at her, their meeting ending shortly after.</p><p>“I will send someone to your chambers tomorrow. Until then.”</p><p>The next day she woke up and her attendants prepared her for the day ahead. Finishing her breakfast she waited for the messenger of the High Bishop.</p><p>‘How much do I need to hold back? I cannot show them how much mana I truly have. It would be like painting a big fat target on my back that I really, really do not want right now. Bezewanst only had mednoble-level mana from what I remember so he will be my benchmark I guess.’</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted with a knock at the door. Wilma opened it and one of the High Bishop attendants stepped inside. He informed her the High Bishop was on his way to the Dedication Ritual chamber and he was to be her escort. Getting up, she and her attendants began to follow him.</p><p>It was showtime.</p>

    <p>His life at the temple was as mind numbingly boring as always. Were it not for the presence of the Goddess of Light shining rays into his life, he would be completely apathetic by now.</p><p>After being unfairly thrown into the blasted temple for having too low mana for his status and his mother’s death, he was denied his birthright by his remaining family.</p><p>Only his reliable older Sister cared at least somewhat for him, enabling his position as High Bishop. Her continued support also enabled him to get some of the comforts he was supposed to have.</p><p>But having offerings of sweet fruit or flowers was only the bare minimum what he deserved after his suffering here! It was barely tolerable at this point, was this dull and hollow existence really all there was for him?</p><p>Another bright light in the darkness was his beloved niece Georgine. Such a bright child she was. Were it not for the birth of her brother Sylvester, she may very well have become the new Archduchess and his ticket to his rightful place among the Nobility.</p><p>He could not believe what his caring older sister did to her. Selling her and his chance at greatness to Ahrensbach. Another life ruined by the family that condemned him to a life here. At least they could still exchange their mutual hardships via magic letters. It was a small consolation.</p><p>Life only got worse then.</p><p>That pampered bastard child of Adelbert, the last Archduke, invaded his territory after his father’s death. Supposedly Sylvester had, as the new Archduke, sent him to the temple as the new High Priest to protect his mother from him.</p><p>Ha, as if his older sister needed protection from some arrogant brat. Truly, exactly what he needed in his rotten life. A pompous former Archduke candidate disrupting his life even more, always reminding him of the life he could have had every time he laid his eyes on him. Great.</p><p>He was not fooled. This was just an attempt to make his life even more miserable by disrupting his business, preventing his rightful lifestyle here at the temple. He did not miss every opportunity to put this upstart in his place wherever he could. At least that was something.</p><p>Then another light graced his dreary life here at the temple. The newly born daughter of an Archnoble family of his sister’s faction was thrown to a life in the temple because of her low mana. Just like his family had once done to him. Just another unfortunate soul joining the misery here.</p><p>At first he was peeved at the timing, it meant missing his chance to acquire another delectable flower in the form of Jenni. Young Sister Christine just got called back by her family from the temple before her baptism to leave the temple's protection. Ha, protection they called it. Oh how he envied her and the others for the opportunity. Even if it was just to compensate for the mana drought caused by the civil war. He would take any excuse at this point.</p><p>Just before departing, Christine gracefully gifted her now former attendants to the baby girl as her new aides. He could do nothing but smile as it all happened, because this made the transition that much easier for all parties involved. Maddening.</p><p>He just smiled and accepted, it was a loss for sure but he had had worse. It was not until her fourth spring after joining that he got slightly curious about the girl. One of her attendants asked his permission to borrow a book from the book room for her young mistress to read.</p><p>A book. To read...for a four year old girl? What madness was this?!</p><p>His interest peaked now, the young gray told him the most wondrous tale he ever heard. The young girl could already read and write at the end of her third winter! Her attendants had no new material for her to read and this request was their next step to pacify their charge. It was absurd!</p><p>He allowed the borrowing under the condition of meeting the young girl to personally verify their claims. He left to meet them two days later, stopping at the book room to get a book for the girl. One of his aides carried it as he made his way to her chambers.</p><p>Upon meeting the young girl the first time since her induction as a baby he nearly did a double take. She was like a child version of Goddess Mestionora. He had just seen her image in the book room as it held her Statue. Flowing, Midnight-blue hair framing a childish, but quite pretty face. Golden Eyes like waxy full moons sparkled with obvious joy at seeing the book he brought. What?</p><p>It took him no more time than a bell to verify their claims. The girl was indeed capable in reading and even writing at the tender age of four among other things like using number calculation. She was obviously a genius. If not for her mana she would excel possibly even in noble society, as she was an Archnoble daughter after all. But wait.</p><p>If her mana is the issue, could he…? Why not? He was the High Bishop. The highest authority. The law. His mind made up, he sent one of his attendants to fetch Schutzaria’s Shield. Explaining to her that he nearly forgot to check her mana in his review was no trouble at all. The result was stunning.</p><p>She had more than enough mana for her age. Gods, it was even more than he dared hope. She was truly blessed by the gods. This would do. Oh yes this could work splendidly. The Gods granted him another chance at least.</p><p>He would hold his hand protectively over this girl, win her trust just like with his lovely niece. And in time would contact her birth parents to reinstate her before her baptism.</p><p>The higher she could climb the better, maybe reach the Archducal family or possibly even a first wife? Maybe he could finally escape the temple then and with her gratitude take his rightful place at least.</p><p>It surely was a long shot but what could he possibly lose? The answer was nothing. And in return win everything he ever wanted. Brilliant.</p><p>Just at the beginning of the girls fifth winter season and her first participation in the upcoming Dedication Ritual, she fell sick with a fever. His worries about his plans for her were unfounded as the girl recovered quickly enough.</p><p>He sent Delia, a young girl her age who was more likely to earn her trust, to set up a meeting just before the Ritual to access her. Upon meeting her, he not only was assured of his investment’s health, he even gained a chance to plant another pair of eyes and ears on that unpleasant former Archduke candidate that invaded his realm. The gods truly favored him today.</p><p>Her ability to bargain for more material to read in return was just another confirmation of her potential to rise in noble society. It was such an amusing plea, he granted it for free this time. It was just more possible goodwill, cheaply purchased.</p><p>Another step in his role of a loving uncle figure was to guide her for the steps in the Dedication Ritual. He sent someone to fetch her and made his way to the chamber. Where he met her and began his instructions for her to follow.</p><p>Not only did she learn the required steps quickly, she even managed to remember the necessary prayer on her first try. A genius indeed. He could also verify her mana had grown even more than he could possibly have dreamt of. She could certainly match his capacity long enough to fill multiple chalices in a reasonable enough time together.</p><p>Congratulating her, he sent her to rest for tomorrow's ceremony. His investment in little Rozemyne was growing splendidly. It was only a matter of time now.</p><p>Good. He could Wait.</p>

    <p>
  <span>Her plans lay in utter ruin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her timetable during the Dedication Ritual was more packed than she anticipated beforehand. After seeing her excellence in their previous lessons, her trusty art attendants took it upon themselves to make her lessons even more challenging. It did not help that she suggested more bodily activities like dancing, to increase this new body's abilities she needed in the future for what she had planned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jenni’s eyes shone like stars as she suggested it and her lesson plan expanded even more. Her first lessons learning to play the harspiel surprised Rosina at first, then made her glow with excitement like she got an original song. She dreaded what would follow, and sure enough, her lesson plan expanded. Again. WHY???</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even worse it seems they even got support from the High bishop of all people. What was the deal with that anyway? He was kind to her, and even gifted her access to the book room practically for free! He basically acted like he was some caring grandpa or something, what was his angle? Obviously he had plans to use her, somehow. But for what?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <span>It can not be my mana, I held back a lot in the Ritual and he wasn’t shocked or anything like that. As of now, I have no money or trends to speak of so what is he after?’</span>
</p><p>And so came the end of the Dedication Ritual and she still got nothing done except lessons and some reading in between supplying mana. At least she could read sometimes. But now she had another hurdle to prepare for, namely the meeting with Ferdinand in two days.</p><p>‘Seeing Ferdinand again after everything that happened...’</p><p>She did not know what to think, or feel. This was not her Ferdinand, but a stranger. This Ferdinand never protected or saved her, gave her hugs and became a part of her family. Never left for Ahrensbach, never aban-NO! She could NOT think about that now. Her mana began to stir as she struggled with her emotions. Taking a deep breath, she began to calm down.</p><p>‘Clear your head. You are fine. Everything is fine! You came back, there is no need to get emotional about the past. It never happened. WILL not happen! Not this time.’</p><p>Regaining her previous composure was not easy but she managed. Now, worse than before, as a Veronican born noble he would be even more suspicious of her than normal, maybe even malicious. She was a potential tool, the question was what was his aim? The same arguments as with the High Bishop applied here. No, there were even fewer reasons. Why was he reaching out to her like that? It was unusual. Those thoughts gave her nothing so she decided to simply take a wait and see approach for now.</p><p>Two days later she made her way to the High Priest quarters for her meeting with Ferdinand at third bell. Wilma signaled their arrival and after receiving affirmation opened the door, allowing her to enter into the oh so familiar room. Ferdinands gaze fell upon her as she strode towards him and after kneeling, arms crossed before her chest, she began her noble greetings, making sure to tightly rein in her mana. She could not use the slightest bit for what she was about to say.</p><p>“Greetings High Priest, I am called Rozemyne. Seeing I am as of now not yet baptized, I cannot offer you my Blessings. May I nevertheless offer a prayer in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe?</p><p>“You may”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, I pray that the High Priest may be spared from your harsh judgment.”</p><p>Confirming no blessing was cast was a great relief. Getting up from the ground she faced Ferdinand again to start the meeting proper as she straightened her back again, adopting her demure noble lady standing pose and smile.</p><p>“High Priest, you called for a meeting. How can this humble apprentice shrine maiden be of assistance?”</p><p>He eyed her critically now, she could practically feel his cold gaze. Searching for a potential weakness in her bearing to exploit. He would find none. His brow furrowed slightly, did she surprise him?</p><p>“Yes Sister Rozemyne, I called for you. I hope you are aware of your upcoming duties as an apprentice shrine maiden, now that you entered your fifth Winter season? Specifically the preparation for administrative duties required.”</p><p>“I was informed of them just this season. Yes, my current attendants have already finished incorporating them into my lessons at the behest of the High Bishop as of four days ago.”</p><p>I could feel his gaze getting just a tad sharper at my blatant reminder of the fake Santa’s unusual involvement, and all of its up- and downsides, in my current life. He was clearly annoyed at my soft rebuke but continued on anyway.</p><p>“I see. I am aware this may seem unusual, but given the current condition of the land and specifically the temple, our administrative capabilities are one of the most impacted as my predecessors in those duties all returned to their families.</p><p>Seeing as those positions are in dire need of replacements and you are currently beginning to learn similar material, I hope you may be amenable to work as an assistant for the foreseeable future or at least until your lessons in those fields are sufficiently covered.”</p><p>So that was his motive? He desperately needed help for paperwork? Why her though, he had just reluctantly accepted help in the past from his fellow blue robes. What changed? Hmm, time for the negotiations to begin. She adopted her trusted Angelica pose.</p><p>“Oh my, what melodies did Ordoschnelli sing for you to believe I would be capable of what you are asking? I am but a humble servant of the gods, short of entering but my sixth spring season. Your confidence in my supposed abilities is flattering.”</p><p>His brow did fully raise this time, his expression becoming even more frosty than before if that was even possible. She awaited his response with anticipation.</p><p>“My sources only sang the brightest melodies about your blessings from Mestionora. The High Bishop also already gave his approval of my suggestion. Was their trust misplaced?”</p><p>Ohhhhh. So that was his angle. He wanted a much needed assistant for paperwork and at the same time placated Bezewanzt with her placement as his spy. Maybe he was even curious about her? He probably underestimated her because in the end she was just a small child. But was he regretting it now? He just gave her a possible way out, did he not? That would not do.</p><p>“My, I certainly do not hope this is the case. All this praise warms my heart, oh so much. Still I must ask, are you offering to become Erwachlehren for Mestionora?”</p><p>‘Ha, his eyebrow just twitched, he is annoyed alright. I guess it has been a long time since he had negotiations, even more being on the back foot on them.’</p><p>“I...am. I hope you find this proposition favorable?”</p><p>‘By the gods that was his equivalent for a stutter! And he is starting to grimace! I am enjoying this way too much. Just one more push!’</p><p>She exited her angelica pose and donned her best Lady smile now. Letting her smile slightly grow, his shoulders tensed subtly. It was indeed time to see how much she could gain from this.</p><p>“Oh, they are most favorable indeed. As a true follower of Goddess Mestionora how could I possibly refuse such an offer from someone of your reputation outright. On another note, is there more you planned in advance for this?”</p><p>He had a slight processing error now. In the corner of her eyes she faintly noticed the gray robes had wide eyes now, staring at her in either disbelief or smug pride in the case of her attendants.</p><p>“...Planned more?”</p><p>“Of course, as tempting as your offer to become my Erwachlehren is, you must remember that I already have laid out lesson plans that need revision after this. Not to mention my possible commitments as your personal assistant in administrative duties. I am sure you are aware something on this scale was not planned before my baptism at the earliest. It is only right to offer compensation for all that, or was my faith in the lectures of my previous emissaries of Anhaltung misplaced?”</p><p>He simply stared at her now in a full blown processing error. Had she gone too far? Maybe. She took pity on him as she made her next offer.</p><p>“Shall we end this dance of Grammaratur for now and speak plainly, High Priest?”</p><p>It took him a few moments until he replied again. He began to tap his temple.</p><p>“Fine, I can offer you monetary compensation once your lessons are complete and you begin your work as my assistant.”</p><p>Her reply was swift.</p><p>“That is only a matter of course, naturally we need to specify what completing my lessons entails specifically. What else?”</p><p>“...What do you suggest?”</p><p>“I am unsure as of this moment, how about we revisit this point after I completed my learning period and begin my new post? In the worst case, if we cannot reach a satisfying agreement, we can both walk away from this with at least part of our desires fulfilled.”</p><p>Ferdinands tapping intensified until he stopped completely. Facing her with his unreadable expression restored once again.</p><p>“That is acceptable.”</p><p>She glanced at her trusty head attendant, and gesticulated to Ferdinand’s nearest gray robe, which was Fran.</p><p>“Agreed, Jenni if you please?”</p><p>Jenni walked to Fran and handed him wooden boards containing a copy of her current lesson plans she let them prepare beforehand. His eyes got even wider upon seeing it took multiple boards for this alone.</p><p>“Seeing as my old plans need your revision, let us arrange another meeting through our attendants. I eagerly await your coming reply, High Priest. I pray that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>Bidding her farewell she departed back to her chambers.</p><p>‘Yahoo! Rozemyne one, Ferdinand zero.’</p><p>It was a good start in her books. Speaking of, it was the start of her reading time now. She could not suppress her grin upon arriving back at her chambers. Now how to go about Benno and Gilberta? Hmm...</p>

    <p>He did not know what to think. At the end of this winter he received a message from the temple that one of the current apprentice shrine maidens wanted to meet a representative of his and his sister's Store, the Gilberta company.</p><p>Why ask to meet a representative if she’s simply ordering one of the seamstresses to give them instructions as was the norm? The name given gave no clues for this either. His contacts never heard of Lady Rozemyne before.</p><p>Not knowing at least something about the noble wanting a meeting, especially for offering small presents to placate them was too dangerous! He had no desire to anger the noble in question and potentially even lose his store, life or whatever else thank you very much.</p><p>Swallowing his pride there was only one thing he could do. He arranged a meeting with Gustav, the Merchant Guild Master with a side note that time was of the essence. Luckily he received a positive reply for the next day.</p><p>Swallowing the remarks about requiring his help was not easy but he managed somehow. After some useless banter it was finally time to get to the heart of the matter.</p><p>“So Benno, what oh so important matter brought you to me and ask for my help hmm?”</p><p>Gustavs smile did not improve his mood at all.</p><p>“I need your help in acquiring information about a member of the temple. Specifically some apprentice blue shrine maiden named Lady Rozemyne. She wants to meet a representative of my store, but I could not get any info about her from my usual sources. So I came to you.”</p><p>The old man’s smile vanished instantly upon hearing the name of his potential noble host.</p><p>“Uh Benno, I don’t think you will like my answer. I indeed have the information you seek but...”</p><p>Wait what? He already knew who he was talking about? The old man looked at him with pity now. Not a good sign at all.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne is indeed from the temple as you said, she is the daughter of Lady Roselinde, an Archnoble.”</p><p>He was sure his complexion lost enough color to match parchment now. He let out a choked gasp.</p><p>“An Archnoble? You are saying I was summoned by high nobility? Please tell me you are joking old man!”</p><p>“It gets even worse, Lady Roselinde is a member of Lady Veronica’s faction, the mother of our current Aub. Lady Roselinde’s brother is Lord Oswald, who serves as the current Head Attendant of Lord Wilfried, the projected heir of Aub Ehrenfest himself.</p><p>The Archducal Clan?! How much worse could it possibly get?</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne was born in summer, she is currently five.”</p><p>So not only was she an Archnoble but the girl's family has close ties to the Archducal Clan. Plus she was a five year old girl. He was screwed, done, it was over for him. Still he had to ask.</p><p>“Just to make sure, one simple mistake in angering this little girl could possibly mean I would be executed?”</p><p>The Guild Masters grim answer chilled him to the bone.</p><p>“Oh, not just you. Try killing your whole family. Everyone you are an acquaintance with too if you fumble up too much and she has a bad day. You know nobles see us as nothing. It hardly matters to them. Members of the Veronica faction are especially callous. It would not be the first time.”</p><p>“How can you be so calm about this?!”</p><p>He could not hold his voice any longer. Gustav remained unfazed.</p><p>“Well, look at the bright side. The girl asked to meet you. Sure it is obviously an order but she has gone out of her way to word it like a request. She did not even set a fixed date but warned you so you have time to prepare.</p><p>Dealing with nobles always puts your life at risk, the rewards are simply growing the higher you go. This is either the opportunity of a lifetime or your end. Just ensure it is the former. Simple as that”</p><p>The words calmed his racing mind somewhat, maybe he was simply overreacting? But wait, something did not add up.</p><p>“Say, how did you know all this at the top of your head? You reacted as soon as I mentioned her name.”</p><p>Gustav smiled sardonically at him now.</p><p>“Of course, I received a similar message from her. I welcome you in our shared misery. There is a chance for it to not be quite so bleak though. Say how much do you know about noble customs pertaining to the temple?”</p><p>A chance?</p><p>“Nothing much, what do you mean?”</p><p>Gustav reclined in his chair, releasing a tired sign.</p><p>“You have to understand that for nobles mana is everything. It dictates your status in Society, who you marry, if you can have children and the list just goes on endlessly. My point being for a child, having the expected levels of mana for its station is a huge deal. Following me so far?”</p><p>Strange but not the weirdest he heard of nobles so far, what was his point?</p><p>“Sure, go on.”</p><p>“You see, a child failing to meet this expectation is usually demoted to lower ranks like a laynoble if possible, made into a rightless servant of its family, or chucked into the temple as a blue robed priest or shrine maiden.</p><p>What did they do to their children? Were nobles really so heartless? Gustav continued.</p><p>“Children in the temple can be reinstated in their families if required. It happened only recently with quite a few families after the conclusion of the civil war. The thing is I could not find out if Lady Rozemyne has the support of her family or not. Should that not be the case, the worst she can do is kill us, but at least that’s pretty much it in that case. If she has, and we anger her, anything I said before applies and we, and everything we know, are pretty much screwed.”</p><p>Was that supposed to reassure him? It failed, miserably. He grimaced.</p><p>“I see. So what do we gift her then?”</p><p>A tired sigh was his answer.</p><p>“Nothing for now, but be prepared to make concessions in return.”</p><p>After this mind shattering conversation he made his way back home to talk with his sister and her husband Otto about the news. Of course they were as terrified as him at first. But he managed to calm them down with the same arguments Gustav provided. Both were appalled about the children part, of course but it was as it was. Now they only had to wait to be summoned.</p><p>It was mid spring when they finally received the summon. At third Bell of the coming Leafday. Donning his best attire, he met Gustav at the guild and they departed together in a carriage to the temple. He silently prayed to any god he could remember. A woman in gray robes welcomed them to the temple and guided them both to a luxurious waiting room, telling them to wait until she had informed her mistress of their arrival.</p><p>As he steeled his nerves for the meeting to come, it did not take long for her to return. Trailing behind her they arrived at their destination in no time at all. Entering the room both of them approached, then kneeled before the young girl that held their fate in her hands. Gustav, as his senior, gave the expected greetings.</p><p>“Greetings Lady Rozemyne, I am Gustav, the Merchant Guild Master and Head of the Othmar Company. Beside me is my fellow Merchant, Benno of the Gilberta Company. May this meeting, ordained by the gods be blessed on this fruitful day given life by Flutrane, Goddess of Water’s healing.”</p><p>“I pray that Flutrane, the Goddess of Water may grant her divine blessing upon this meeting.”</p><p>Standing up they took the offered seats and he finally took in the appearance of his current host. She had golden eyes and hip-length, midnight-blue hair, framing a quiet pretty face with a pale complexion. What instantly stood out to him was her silky and unusually glossy hair. He refocused his attention as she began to speak.</p><p>“I was informed commoners are not fluent in Grammaratur’s dance but prefer direct speech instead. I will try my best to speak plainly to avoid potential misunderstandings. Should you have questions or wish to seek confirmation for something, please do not hesitate to ask.”</p><p>“We thank you from the bottom of our hearts, you honor us with your most gracious lenience.”</p><p>Well that didn’t start how he expected. This young noble girl was going out of her way to make their life easier? His curiosity only grew.</p><p>“I am sure you wonder why I have summoned you both for a meeting, instead of simply ordering for a Seamstress from Gilberta, correct?”</p><p>It was his turn to speak now he realized.</p><p>“Yes, it did surprise me. Whatever do you require from me or the Gilberta Company Lady Rozemyne?</p><p>The peaceful smile she wore widened slightly.</p><p>“Good on you for asking, why of course I intend to purchase your services for my new Ceremonial Dress. But that is hardly the reason for your presence. No, after some deliberation I decided to offer you both first rights to market a new product I created recently, after a vision from the Gods.”</p><p>“A new product you say, my Lady?”</p><p>That answer left him slightly stumped. A new product? A vision from the Gods? What could a little girl possibly have invented that could interest a shop like his or Gustavs for that matter? Returning from his internal musing his blood cooled as he took in the new grin she now sported. It was the unmistakable carnivorous grin of a merchant preparing to devour his prey.</p><p>“Oh I am sure it will sell well. In fact I believe it will become quite profitable. Why, don’t think I haven’t noticed that your eyes remained on my hair longer than was strictly appropriate Benno.“</p><p>He was pretty sure his complexion lost much of his coloring with her statement. She noticed that? How observant was this girl?! Did he already sign his death warrant? Gustav made to speak but before he could she continued to speak.</p><p>“I will forgive it this time, for your intuition was indeed correct. The product I am speaking about is a hair tonic, responsible for the glossy sheen you noticed. I call it Rinsing shampoo or Rinsham for short. I take it that you are interested?”</p><p>Thank the Gods she forgave him for now! But did he hear that right? This girl offered them not just a simple product but an entire Industry?! He was so stunned it was Gustav who replied first.</p><p>“I believe I speak for the both of us when I say we of Othmar and Gilberta would be most honored to accept such a gracious offer. What are the terms?”</p><p>The girl adopted a thinking pose, her hand resting on her right cheek now.</p><p>“Hm I currently possess only a few bottles worth, after my experiments. Mind you I am currently in the process of establishing a workshop here in the temple Orphanage for future production. I ask that you prepare at least one additional workshop each in the coming season for now.</p><p>Pertaining payment I will set the purchase price for production rights at five small gold. Additionally I think twenty percent of profit of all sold products in the first two years and thirty in the following years until my death are a good deal overall. Finally we shall all sign duchy wide magic contracts about the selling and production terms, as well as a non-disclosure and aggression pact from your side. Is this amenable so far?”</p><p>Never in his life did he feel as overwhelmed as right now. Where would he even begin with this? It was again Gustav who intervened.</p><p>“I humbly beg your forgiveness Lady Rozemyne, but are the monetary terms discussable?”</p><p>“I am willing to lower the purchase fee and the first two year percentages, the yearly thirty percent is non-negotiable.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“...”</p><p>After a short while she made another offer.</p><p>“How about this? I will waive the purchase price for the production method in exchange of Othmar and Gilberta carrying the Contract cost, purchasing all of my twenty-four finished examples for one small gold together and your help in finding two cooks of my choosing to enter my service.</p><p>She wanted cooks too now? No wait. He needed to focus.</p><p>Her last offer was not as agreeable as he wanted but possibly the best he would get at this point. Never mind the threat of execution, should he refuse, hanging over his head.</p><p>“Yes I believe this is agreeable. I humbly accept these terms on behalf of Gilberta, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I also agree on behalf of Othmar, Lady Rozemyne. Rest assured that finding the cooks you require will pose no problem. May I inquire about their names?”</p><p>Her expression returned to the peaceful smile she wore before at their answer.</p><p>“Most Excellent, I am glad you both agree. The names of the cooks in question are Hugo and the apprentice Ella. I look forward to their services. Now, regarding Gilberta, when can I expect your sister Corinna to arrive to prepare my dress?”</p><p>He gulped, sweat starting to form on his temple. She knew the name of his sister? He forced a smile on his lips.</p><p>“You honor us by knowing the name of my sister. She will be ready at your earliest convenience Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Is that so? Very good, please talk with my head attendant Jenni after our meeting concludes. She can give you a possible date.”</p><p>The woman standing directly behind her on the left side gave him a small nod and bow. He nodded back and focused his attention back to the girl as she now addressed Gustav again.</p><p>“And now Guild Master I have something personal to ask of you first, if that is alright?”</p><p>“Of course Lady Rozemyne, ask what you wish.”</p><p>Ha, as if Gustav had the ability to refuse her.</p><p>“Good, am I correctly informed that you have a granddaughter called Freida?”</p><p>Her question caused Gustav to pale rapidly, sweat emerging on his forehead. Even he was taken aback. She knew about Freida too?</p><p>“I- Yes I have Lady Rozemyne but I don’t follow?”</p><p>Her expression remained the same but she got an evil glint in her eyes now as she posed her next question.</p><p>“Furthermore, am I correct in the knowledge you recently signed a Mistress contract with the head of house Bernett in exchange for her free use of magic tools to counter her Devouring?”</p><p>What?! Little Freida had the Devouring? How did she know all that? Poor Gustav was close to fainting now, sweating even more. And who could blame him. That little noble girl was way too dangerous!?</p><p>“H-How- I mean Yes you are correct Lady Rozemyne. But-”</p><p>“Oh! Most excellent, I will inquire with Lord Henrik about a possible transfer of her contract into my service then. Having the Granddaughter of the Merchant Guild Master in the hands of a mere Lay noble household is too much of a risk. Don’t you agree?”</p><p>The innocent expression the girl wore did not match her words at all! She just practically took Freida hostage and dangled it in their face to boot! Gustav slumped in his seat, seemingly accepting his fate.</p><p>“...It is as you say my Lady.”</p><p>“I am delighted we could all come to an agreement and even prevent such a potential disaster from happening. May Flutrane, the Goddess of Water and Greifechan, the Goddess of Luck, bless this most fruitful meeting.”</p><p>With this obvious dismissal both of them got up and after a short bow the attendant she called Jenni took him to the side to arrange dates for Corinna to begin her work and escorted the both of them to the exit of the temple. After this both him and Gustav entered the carriage for their return, Gustav burrowing his head into his hands in obvious despair.</p><p>He did not really know what to say so he kept his silence until their arrival at the guild. Bidding his farewells he returned to inform his sister about the news. Well at least it was not him he mused.</p><p>‘I will repeat myself. That girl is way, way too dangerous!’</p>

    <p>Rozemyne unsettled him.</p><p>Who would have thought it would be a small child to have such a deep impact on him. It was absurd.</p><p>His curiosity was first peaked when his sources informed him that Bezewanst went out of his way to visit a little apprentice blue shrine maiden that had not even been baptized yet. The girl may be the daughter of a member of Veronica's faction but still. Normally the pompous oaf would just send word to come to him, not the other way around. What was his motive? Maybe he intended to groom her to be one of his future flowers?</p><p>He quickly discarded that line of thought, it made him highly uncomfortable just to think about something like that. In the end it was just an irrelevant happenstance, not worthy of his time. He had enough work to contend with after his brother Sylvester dumped his work on him. Again. At least this gave him more evidence of corruption for his collection, so that was something at least.</p><p>The next time he heard about the girl was when one of his gray robe attendants informed him he overheard the girls attendants were discussing what to get their young charge to read, as they were running out of materials for her. He found it unusual enough to report it to him and Ferdinand agreed.</p><p>They are running out of reading material? The girl was just four if he remembered correctly. How could they possibly run out? Wait a moment. The girl could read fluently enough to run out of material after becoming four so that meant she could already read at three?!</p><p>A cold feeling bloomed in his stomach. The girl could potentially be a child genius like himself, and Bezewanst was already aware of her. Which meant his sister may be too...No it was none of his business. Why should he care about some random girl? He had enough problems himself. He would let one of his grays monitor the situation from now on though. Just to be safe.</p><p>...</p><p>And maybe extend an invitation to assess her himself when he had the time to spare. Just to make sure.</p><p>The cold feeling receded.</p><p>Just before the Dedication Ritual this winter season he was informed that the girl fell ill with a fever. After recovering she was then summoned to a meeting by Bezewanst. Well nothing much unusual at this point. What was unusual was that the oaf was instructing her in the Ritual. Himself. The High Bishop’s mood was at an all time high right after, which was even more worrying.</p><p>Now it was time to assess her himself. She arrived with a grace not usually found in even archduke candidates until they were about to enter the royal academy, let around children her age. The Greetings she gave were acceptable and her poise as she stood up after finishing was immaculate. Interesting, but it was her appearance that threw him slightly off. She was like a miniature Mestionora, walking out of the bible to greet him.</p><p>Starting their conversation he was slightly annoyed at her cheek but that was not the most confusing part no. She was clearly adept in the dance of Grammaratur, enough so that she threw him off several times. She even managed to corner him into giving multiple concessions in addition to a promise to teach her. How?!</p><p>Who was this girl? She was clearly much too advanced for a five year old noble daughter, let alone a blue shrine maiden apprentice. What was going on? Revising her lesson plan revealed it was absolutely bloated with material far too advanced for her age. And why were there so many dancing and harspiel lessons? It made no sense at all. This was absurd!</p><p>It did not get better after her first lesson with him. It took her receiving only the most basic overview of the terminology and procedures to begin her work. Her ability to work with numbers was insane. She did not even need a calculator, she could seemingly calculate large numbers just in her head. At their second session her work speed rivaled his. Without errors. By the Divine Couple she was five! He had so many questions now...</p><p>The absurdity did not end there. The next session after that she requested to become the new Orphanage Director. The post was free of course after Sister Margaret climbed the towering heights, but her reasoning...</p><p>“You aspire to become the new Orphanage Director?”</p><p>“Yes Ordoschnelli’s melodies were mostly off tune regarding their circumstances. The state of the orphanage is an affront to Wiegenmilch. But even more appalling, it is draining an unnecessarily high part of the temple budget, which is small enough already. I intend to become Flutrane to make it self-sustained. Maybe even invoke Greifechan’s favor. But only Dregarnuhr’s weave may grace us with Anhaltung.“</p><p>‘So she thinks she can improve their condition enough to make them self-sufficient? And even thinks she can make a profit? It is true that some rumors circulate about the poor state of the orphanage, but to think even a young child like her was aware of them? What a disgrace, still I need to ask.’</p><p>“You believe yourself capable of that?”</p><p>“Of course, I am blessed by the Gods after all.”</p><p>“...Very well.”</p><p>Shortly after taking up her new position she summoned some Merchants to the temple. He did not really care, most likely it was part of her plans for the supposed self-sustainability she talked about. It was the thing she asked of him after all of that which threw him off. Again.</p><p>“You want to rent a noble ring or something similar for a day? Why?”</p><p>“Seeing as I am handling important administrative material for my ongoing project in the Orphanage now, I intend to construct a hidden room in my new office.”</p><p>“How do you even know about that? Anyway you could have simply requested my assistance for that. I am your current Erwachlehren after all.”</p><p>“It warms my heart oh so much to know Mestionora’s trust in her Erwachlehren was justified. But will involving you into the creation not mean you can enter it too?”</p><p>“Technically yes but I will simply lend you a ring as I instruct you in its creation.”</p><p>“I thank you oh so much, High Priest.”</p><p>‘I am beginning to question if becoming her teacher was a mistake...’</p>

    <p>She was beginning to worry.</p><p>So far everything she did worked out in some kind of way without any strange occurrences. She successfully became the Orphanage Director again with only a token resistance after explaining her plans to make it self-sufficient.</p><p>Reforming the whole place and creating her workshop went much smoother this time. She had to bribe the Fake Santa again, as he would without a doubt take a chunk of the profit margins for himself but that was acceptable right now. Soon she would have everything ready to begin Rinsham mass production to kickstart her economic ambitions. Speaking of.</p><p>The meeting with Benno and the Guild Master worked out splendidly too. She got most of the conditions she wanted and still left them enough margin for profit. She even got the opportunity to snatch Freida up from the stupid mistress contract she had. Really for someone with her talent to rot away as a simple mistress was such a stupid waste. She may have gone about it the wrong way in the past weave but in the end she simply wanted her as a friend. She would make sure Freida got all the opportunities in the world to work on merchant related matters to her heart's content in her employ.</p><p>She did wonder why Benno and Gustav were so tense the whole time though? She did her best to be as accommodating as a person in her position could possibly be. She was not even the Archduke’s daughter this time, just a simple blue shrine maiden, not even a full noble. Strange.</p><p>Anyway the noble side of her knew Freida could not escape being separated from her family, having mana as a commoner made sure of that. Not to mention her future plans but she digressed. On a more somber note, how could she let the opportunity escape her grasp to strengthen her economic grasp on the duchy through the Othmar Company and the Merchant Guild Master? Everyone would win in the end so all was good in her book.</p><p>On the topic she did not miss sending someone to purchase the book she remembered rotting in the lower city market this time. It took a good chunk out of her savings but it was worth it. The poor thing was exposed to sunlight in a glass case for years! Now it was safely tucked away in her possession and safe from harm again. She could not wait to start reading it!</p><p>She used the favor the High Bishop owed her to contact Henrik for an audience. He agreed and upon her inquiry if she should defer to him as a simple shrine maiden, he simply stated she had no need to worry and to simply act as if she was an Arch noble with his backing on the matter. That was a thing? Oh well. The meeting was soon after.</p><p>After giving their noble greetings it was time to start securing her twin-tailed gold fiend.</p><p>“Lord Henrik, I am oh so glad to finally meet you. Has word from Ordoschnelli already reached your ears about my inquiry?”</p><p>“I apologize, Lady Rozemyne, sadly I did not hear any melodies regarding such a matter. Whatever do you need of me?”</p><p>‘What did the Fake Santa say to make him so tense?’</p><p>“Oh I see, do not worry it is a most simple matter. You are currently holding a mistress contract with a girl named Freida, correct?”</p><p>“That is indeed correct my Lady. But pardon me, I do not follow?”</p><p>His eyes widened slightly before recomposing himself and answering her question.</p><p>“Most wonderful. You see, I recently entered into relations with the followers of Greifechan, the Othmar Company being among them. Imagine my surprise upon discovering that not only does the beloved granddaughter of the Merchant Guild Master suffer from the Devouring, but additionally is to enter a mere mistress contract with House Bernett through you, the poor girl.”</p><p>His eyes got even wider this time and he paled slightly. It took him longer than she expected to answer so she continued.</p><p>“Lord Henrik I know it may be rude but how about we forsake the dance of Grammaratur and speak plainly?”</p><p>He simply nodded, still wide eyed and was he sweating now? She simply gave him a blank stare.</p><p>“Thank you. Now I hope you are aware that after I discovered this I can not simply allow a Laynoble family like yours to hold such an asset. Especially not after I and through me the temple just entered into business relations with them.”</p><p>“I would never dare to pressure that, my Lady perish the thought!”</p><p>‘Oh he is panicking now. I went too far, oops.’</p><p>She sighed dramatically.</p><p>“Calm yourself, I only intend to acquire her contract, nothing more. I am willing to reimburse you for the associated costs.”</p><p>“Truly? Is she worth so much to you?”</p><p>She shrugged at his question before responding.</p><p>“The temple currently needs more mana and the leverage I gain will ensure their loyalty. That is all there is for now.”</p><p>After hammering out the details they agreed to schedule a date for the old contract to be dissolved. Gustav was still distressed in her presence for whatever reason. Whatever he would calm down in time. Freida simply eyed her curiously.</p><p>The new contract mandated for Freida to never reveal her secrets and work as her direct subordinate upon her baptism. In exchange she would get a new children magic tool to combat her overflowing mana. As she purchased the current bracelet from Lord Henrik they could keep it until then and simply offload it in the temple for now. She assured them she could stay with her family until conditions changed. They would have further talks in the future and that was that.</p><p>After that she even got the opportunity to create a hidden room for herself for free after asking Ferdinand to lend her a ring. It seemed that her efforts to make his life easier at least in the administrative sense earned her some good girl points with him. Hehe.</p><p>After having now established her hidden room it was finally time to get to work for real. She mainly concentrated on getting into form, incorporating stretches, jogging and whatever she could think of that was possible inside of her hidden room. Additionally she confirmed she could still use enhancement magic somewhat.</p><p>Using her new merchant contacts and growing wealth it was possible to acquire materials to construct an improvised brewing station with enough ingredients for her planned projects. Added was a sack full of low quality Feystones her merchant contacts could acquire without arousing too much suspicion. It would do for now.</p><p>First was her new temporary highbeast feystone, one of the essential tools she needed for her upcoming plans until she got her hands on her official one in the future. Next was a cheap magic ring. Casting some prayers as a testing method it only withstood a dozen of them before breaking and turning into gold sand. Still it was a roaring success.</p><p>Quite lucky for her too as she ran out of ingredients after finishing the third one. Well she only needed one for now. She was so busy with all the preparations, lessons, business and administrative stuff it was already autumn! The Harvest Festival was just around the corner, which suited her current plans just fine.</p><p>She had acquired a simple brown cape that covered her body, paired with a hood in the same coloring. Next was a pair of simple shirts and pants. A headscarf for binding her hair just in case the hood should come loose. Using some feystones she created a simple facemask with eye slits and her new disguise was complete!</p><p>She took the small cooking blade she smuggled to her room from the Orphanage kitchens into her hand. The knife had been heavily modified by molding some of the feystones into it, extending the blade to a length appropriate for her current body to wield. The edge was capable of channeling her mana to hone its sharpness even further. After its transformation it now resembled a short sword more than a knife. It was a far cry from what she wielded in her past but it would more than suffice. Turning the blade to see her eyes reflected on the polished surface she could not suppress her grin.</p><p>‘Now how do I get access to the travel plans I wonder?’</p>

    <p>All the pieces were in place, it was time to ring the Ditter bell.</p><p>After subtly using Verbergen’s Blessing at night to sneak around the temple she found the plans for the planned routes of the coming Harvest Festival simply laying for the world to see on top of the High Bishop’s desk. Using her new highbeast Stone she used the same method, paired with her trusty Lessy to find and prepare a possible hideout.</p><p>After some searching she found a cave which would suit her needs. Placing the four fabrics containing magic circles she prepared beforehand.<br />One she placed and activated right away, it was a transfer circle connecting to its brother in her hidden room. She would use it to teleport back and towards here on the day of her ambush. Another two would come into play afterwards so she simply laid them down without activating them.</p><p>The last one was laid at the entrance of the cave and promptly activated. It was a simple design evoking Verbergen and Schutzaria to shroud said entrance for feybeast and man alike who did not possess her mana. The wind shield would only activate if someone without the same tried to enter the cave.</p><p>Entering the transport circle she was back in her room, from where she left to return into her bed. All preparations were done and now it was time to wait. It was on the second day of the Harvest Festival she would strike.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />She had concealed herself between the trees bordering the road. It was as good enough a place as any. Taking a seat on a rock nearby she began to watch the road for the carriages to appear.</p><p>She chose a place just short of the border between the provinces Dahlolf and Joisontak. Her hope was the distance they had to travel meant the most probable suspect, Ferdinand, was already engaged with another target on his list at this time. Giving him more than enough witnesses and solidifying his alibi. She prayed to Greifechan just to make sure. Now she only had to wait.</p><p>After what felt like forever she finally spied her targets pulling up the road towards her location. Getting up she slid her mask into place and took out three small bags, holding them in her hands. It was her own personal concoction of different ingredients, resulting in a fine powder which when inhaled had an instant strong sedative effect. Sadly it did not linger in the air long enough to affect all passengers without losing its effectiveness and did not work against mana users at all but it was the drivers, horses and servants she was aiming for in the first place.</p><p>Now with her targets nearly upon her position she took aim and threw the first bag with her right hand just between the horses and driver of the first carriage. The bag exploded in a purple cloud as intended, showering her targets and creating quite the commotion. She watched with satisfaction as both the driver and horses slumped over.</p><p>Taking the next bag in her right hand she repeated her actions on the second carriage. Putting them to sleep as well. Drawing her blade she slowly began to advance towards them. Third bag at the ready.</p><p>‘Now in which one of these are you, fake santa?’</p><p>“What is the meaning of all this?!”</p><p>A man storming out of the second carriage gave her all the clues she needed. She threw the last bag through the window of the first carriage to hopefully knock them out too. Her gaze returned to the shouting man again.</p><p>He wore the light armor traditionally worn by knights. His face showed his obvious annoyance at the tumult she caused. His Yellow-Green hair is an unexpected but familiar sight. An unseen grin formed on her face.</p><p>‘Well, well, well. Who would have thought I would find Shikikoza here too. Praise be to Greifechan and Dregarnuhr for working overtime.’</p><p>The walking nightmare of her first Trombe extermination finally noticed her form as she steadily advanced. He formed his Schtappe, aiming it at her before he spoke with a chuckle.</p><p>“Just a lonely child? What kind of joke is this?! And here I was worried for a moment. Learn your place, you filthy commoner!”</p><p>In the next moment he fired a beam of concentrated mana at her, which she easily dodged. Using her enhancement magic to augment her body she rushed at him. Channeling the momentum she built into a sideways thrust of her mana enhanced blade through his left thigh, piercing it and bringing the man to his knees with a cry of pain. Removing her blade from his body, she simply slashed at his throat, which was now in her range.</p><p>The fountain of blood erupting upon his decapitation showering her was not part of her estimations. It seemed her new blade was sharper than anticipated or she had simply put too much strength into her swing. How unfortunate. She had hoped he would die slowly, choking on his own blood. Oh well.</p><p>Stepping away from the now headless corpse she shifted her attention towards the carriage again. Looking inside she saw the Fake Santa frozen in fright, staring at her display in obvious fear, trying to sink further into his seat.</p><p>“S-Stay away from me!!!”</p><p>Entering the carriage she noticed an old man wearing scholarly attire had just opened the door on the other side. Her currently small statue allowed her to perform a roundhouse kick into his side with her right leg. The force propelled him straight through the door, an explosion of wooden splinters following his tumble until he stopped a fair distance away. She really needed to get better control of her enhancement. This was just poor showing at this point. Her dear Hannelore would be appalled at her lacking performance before lamenting she had to retrain her. Again. How embarrassing.</p><p>Returning her attention to the fat waste of space who called himself High Bishop she leveled her blade at him. His groveling for mercy was slightly cathartic for her soul. How many lives had this man’s actions ruined? Not that she had much room to talk but she allowed herself to bask in the moment just a little.</p><p>“R-Rott”</p><p>Her head swirled to her right. The Scholar she just catapulted through the door had seemingly recovered enough to send the red signal for help as she was distracted.</p><p>“Tch.”</p><p>She pierced the head of the old fool in white robes, removing her blade and ignoring the blood and gore sprinkling on her form. Next she moved to the pathetic waste of space crawling on the ground that had shortened her play time. He seemed oddly familiar.</p><p>‘ What was his name? Kan-something? Meh, who cares.’</p><p>A simple swing of her blade slashed through his neck, not waiting a single moment longer she used her best speed dashing into the forest. She had to get away fast, before the Knight Order investigated the distress signal.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />To her great relief she arrived back at her circle inside the cave without being spotted. Deactivating the concealment fabric as she entered. She then loosened her belt holding her equipment before laying it to the side. Afterwards she quickly stripped out of her blood soaked attire, now fully bereft of clothing she placed them on the fabric containing a magic circle evoking Leidenschaft she had prepared beforehand. Activating it she made sure every trace of her outfit was erased before she picked her belt and the fabrics up again, stepping onto the prepared fabric holding a trio of circles she had placed days before.</p><p>The first circle would activate her teleport back to her hidden room. Upon finishing the transfer it would activate the next one evoking Leidenschaft again starting a small fire which would consume the fabric at a slow pace. More than enough time for the last one to do its intended work. Finally the last one would invoke the blessings of the God of Darkness which would consume any remaining mana in its vicinity before turning unto itself erasing any trace of mana usage from the last weeks. Seeing as the fire was not mana dependent at this point it would erase all traces of its existence upon completion. It was one of her creations she was most proud of.</p><p>Upon activating the matrix she was teleported back to her hidden room with a flash, where she rinsed herself with a quick Waschen Prayer. She then donned her undergarments and blue shrine maiden attire again. Afterwards she stashed the belt and fabric away and left the room, citing she had simply fallen asleep to the bemusement of her attendants.</p><p>Maybe she should start reading her new book now? The thought alone made her wiggle in excitement, which earned her lecture from Jenni about her behavior. Why?!</p>

    <p>It was just a normal day in Autumn.</p><p>Or it was until his personal knight and shadow received a most disturbing Ordonnanz from one of his underlings in the Knight Order. It was a shame too as they had just made themselves comfortable in his office.</p><p>“Lord Karstedt, this is Edelfried, I humbly request your immediate presence. Lord Neunfeldt and myself just responded to a Rott to discover the sight of a successful assassination of a priest and tax Collector. We also sent word to the Knight Order for immediate reinforcements. Please make your way to the border between the provinces of Dahlolf and Joisontak at once.”</p><p>The message repeated itself two more times. He had a bad premonition about this. His trusted knight sent him a questioning glance to which he nodded and sent his confirmation.</p><p>“Edelfried, this is Karstedt. Secure the premises, I am on my way.”</p><p>After sending his reply Karstedt sent a look in his direction again.</p><p>“Do you want to come, or shall I depart alone, Sylvester?”</p><p>“No I will come, I have a bad feeling about this.”</p><p>Hastily departing, they left the building and summoned their highbeasts, making their way to the mentioned border, the bad feeling in his stomach growing all the while. It took them some time but they finally spied a lone highbeast hovering in the air in the distance. Upon landing directly below it they laid their eyes on what he could only describe as massacre.</p><p>Two knights were questioning a group of commoners, including gray priests, standing right next to a carriage but that was not what drew his attention.</p><p>‘That’s a freaking body without a head!’</p><p>He let his eyes wander towards the other carriage behind the corpse, what he saw inside made him gasp loudly. It was-</p><p>“It seems someone finally got enough of your uncle's actions and decided to take matters into their own hands.”</p><p>“Karstedt!”</p><p>His knight simply shrugged.</p><p>“Do you truly expect me to show pity here?”</p><p>“No, I don’t. But he was still my uncle. What do you take from all this?”</p><p>Karstedt began walking around, leaving him alone as he tried to ease his revolting stomach. This was a disaster, he could already envision how his mother would react. It was not a pretty thought, his stomach twisted in protest even more.</p><p>“From what I can see at a first glance the attacker was at least a trained mednoble knight, probably higher.”</p><p>Silvester focused his attention back at Karstedt.</p><p>“At least mednoble, why?”</p><p>“This scale of destruction is only possible with enhancement magic. While layknights are capable of that, I doubt it would be to this level... Plus they overwhelmed Shikikoza fairly quickly. That is the name of the headless knight before you ask, he practically has only two wounds. One in his left leg and the other one is his decapitation.</p><p>Whoever did this has experience in combating human foes, so the younger members of the knight order are out, or at least highly unlikely. Additionally, except for their supposed target, only those who were in the way or inconvenienced the assailant were dealt with lethally, all the servants are fine. If I didn't know better I would say my father rampaged here.”</p><p>He paled, of course Bonifatius was not involved but the thought of another person capable of his level of destruction was chilling. Still he steeled himself and assumed his best Aub persona.</p><p>“I see. Karstedt, I demand this whole incident to be thoroughly investigated.”</p><p>As soon as he had finished giving his command Karstedt knelt before him.</p><p>“As you command, Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Mounting his highbeast again, he swiftly returned to the castle, leaving Karstedt to lead the investigation. Upon his return to his office he ordered his retainers to clear the room. He waited until they departed to send an Ordonnanz to his brother.</p><p>“Ferdinand this is Sylvester, I don’t care what you are doing at the moment. Come to my office in the castle, now.”</p><p>After sending the message he walked to his cabinet to get his Vize and two cups. He needed a drink after all this and the discussion to come. It took half a bell until his brother finally arrived, the frown on his face had epic proportions. He simply pointed to the seat opposite from him. Activating a sound blocking magic tool at the same time. His brother’s frown only deepened, taking the offered seat he began eyeing the offered cup of Vize questioningly.</p><p>“Sylvester, what was the reason for your summon? It interrupted the harvest Festival ceremony I was executing.”</p><p>He took another swing before answering.</p><p>“We just discovered that one of the carriages of the Harvest Festival was attacked. My uncle Bezewanst climbed the towering stairway.”</p><p>For his brother, to raise his eyebrow was the equivalent of a surprised shout. His face darkened soon after and he began to tap his temple.</p><p>“Your mother will be furious, were the assailants caught?”</p><p>“No, there is no trace of them. Karstedt is on the scene for the Knight Order to start its investigation immediately.”</p><p>He slumped in his seat, releasing a tired sigh. What did he do to deserve this? Well that was for later. First he had to ask the question, no matter how much he did not want to.</p><p>“You did not do it, right?”</p><p>“Of course not, fool. I am not that foolish.”</p><p>He seemed kind of insulted now, oh boy. He raised his hands in a placating gesture.</p><p>“Hey I know you're not but you know I had to ask.”</p><p>He seemed to accept his apology before giving his rebuke.</p><p>“You know Veronica will blame me or Leisegang anyway, right?”</p><p>And wasn’t that the truth. His mother would become ballistic as soon as word got out. He could already envision her storming into his office, demanding retribution. Great now he had a headache too, how nice. He took another swing.</p><p>“Your retainers?”</p><p>“Justus was with me and we had multiple people around us all the time. My guess is Eckhart was at the knights’ barracks like always and Lasfam could never even attempt something like this. I do not worry about an alibi, she would disregard it regardless.”</p><p>Well that was good enough for him.</p><p>“You can not be part of the investigation, mother would never allow it.”</p><p>It took Ferdinand a while until he nodded his acceptance, but now there were other things to deal with.</p><p>“Seeing as my uncle cannot finish his route, please take up his part, you are the only member of the temple who has a highbeast. Also I know how this will look but I am installing you as the new High Bishop effective immediately. Someone needs to take over your role as High Priest. Is there someone on your mind or must we find a replacement to join the temple?”</p><p>Ferdinand looked away from him tapping his temple even harder now, what was up with that? And did he just grimace?!</p><p>“Well there is but...”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Oh come on you can not leave me hanging after a declaration like that!”</p><p>“It would be highly unorthodox, and probably inappropriate.”</p><p>This was the first time he saw his unshakable brother this unsure about anything, today was truly abnormal.</p><p>“So? Out with it! Who is it?”</p><p>“There is a shrine maiden who I am mentoring currently, she is highly capable in the administrative and leadership parts required. She is also the only archnoble left in the temple at this point so that could be used as an excuse too. Her family may be part of Veronica's faction but that is practically irrelevant in the temple with me as High Bishop now, it's just...”</p><p>What?! His brother mentoring someone? And he was complimenting her too! A member of his mother’s faction? Was the world ending?!</p><p>“So? What is the problem?”</p><p>“She is currently six.”</p><p>He blinked. Surely he heard wrong.</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>“I said she is currently six, she will be seven this summer.”</p><p>He did not even know where to begin with all of this.</p><p>“You mean to say a six year old girl is capable enough to not only endure your lessons, but she impressed you so much you are praising her?!”</p><p>His brother sent him a dark look for this, but it was still worth it for the reaction alone. He could not help himself but smile.</p><p>“Very well, I do not care at this point, if you think she is capable then that is enough for me. She will take your old role effective immediately too. Seeing that she is a minor I will make it Aub’s order.”</p><p>“...Very well.”</p><p>Why was he feeling he would regret his decision? Naw it was probably just his stomach acting up again. How bad could it be?</p>

    <p>She remembered it like yesterday, the fear upon learning that her mistress, Lady Christine, was leaving the temple for her return in noble society, to attend the Royal Academy. She had entered her service as soon as Lady Christine discovered her talent in the arts, specifically dancing and poetry. It was a simple time, allowing her to fully immerse herself in her passion for Kunstzeal, much to her delight.</p><p>It was not until Wilma, another gray shrine maiden in Lady Christine’s employ, was nearly tricked into a flower offering by another blue priest that she became at least partly aware of the favor Greifechan had bestowed upon her until now. It could have been her, taken by that cruel man instead. Thankfully Lady Christine noticed Wilma’s absence and rescued her at the last moment but Wilma was never the same after the incident.</p><p>The fact Lady Christine would be leaving them behind to return to her family was like Verdraeos pulling her from  Schlaftraum’ realm. She could practically feel the greed of the High Bishop, barely concealing  Brennwarme’s flames in his eyes  on her form as he informed them of their mistress’s departure. Only Rosina was promised to be returned to her service upon finishing the Royal Academy, it came to no one's surprise as she was always favored.</p><p>But again Greifechan showed her favor, as a young baby girl was inducted in the temple as a new apprentice blue shrine maiden at nearly the same time.</p><p>As a final act before her departure, Lady Christine transferred the service of Wilma, Rosina and her to the young girl, to be her new attendants. The High Bishop agreed reluctantly and she thanked the gods religiously afterwards for their mercy. She swore to never take her current life for granted again. She would ensure to gain her new mistress' favor, cementing her position so that she has to never fear those eyes again. The thought of that alone made her shudder.</p><p>As all three of them shared the burden of becoming Wiegenmilch for their new mistress Lady Rozemyne, none of them could truly bring themselves to complain. She was simply so adorable, even teaching her proved not difficult at all. Even Rosina began to help them with enthusiasm. Her eyes sparkling at seeing their young charge explore the world around her. Wilma started to emerge from the shell she created since the incident more and more too. The warmth exuding from the young girl's happy laughter was simply too hard to resist.</p><p>Additionally their little mistress absorbed her lessons at an astonishing rate, she even learned the alphabet at the end of her second year and learned to write and read at three. Three! Their little Mestionora even began to devour any and all reading material she could get her tiny little hands on. Forcing them to go out of their way to ask the High Bishop for a book to satisfy her growing search for knowledge.</p><p>She watched with trepidation as the foul man’s eyes took on the same greedy look he once leveled upon her, thankfully they lacked the lust he directed her way. It was a slight relief.</p><p>Her next trial of Glucklitat came as their lady collapsed on the way back to her chambers. The following fever nearly robbed her of Dauerleben’s divine protection until Wilma remembered her lack of mana dedication the days before. They hurriedly asked permission to borrow the shield of Lady Schutzaria, the divine instrument absorbing her lady’s mana, causing her fever to abate. They sighed collectively in relief.</p><p>Upon awakening and collecting her bearings her lady immediately showed her concern for them instead of focusing on her own wellbeing alone. It touched her deeper than she was willing to admit,  though the following summon for a meeting with the High Bishop left a sour aftertaste in her mouth.</p><p>Her lady handled the meeting with a natural grace she could not help but be proud of. In hindsight she should have expected her lady wanting access to the book room and could only silently sigh in resignation, of course she would. Escorting her lady to the book room brought her face to face with a statue of the Goddess Mestionora and she was momentarily struck by Verdraeos again.</p><p>She looked to Wilma, who had followed them in escorting her lady, who had a similar reaction upon laying eyes on the statue. Her focus shifted between the depiction of the goddess and her lady multiple times. Oh, she could already see multiple pictures of her Lady in the future, Wilma’s eyes nearly glowing with a desperate desire to honor Kunstzeal.</p><p>Maybe her lady truly was a divine gift from the gods? An avatar of Mestionora herself? She did begin to act slightly differently since the fever and often made remarks of the gods granting her insight but that could not be possible. Right? Right!? She refocused herself. She still needed to watch over her lady. She would not fail in her duty again.</p><p>She was truly delighted when her lady began to show interest in broadening her knowledge in the realm of Kunstzeal, until now they covered mostly drawing and some singing lessons. But now she demanded to extend her lessons to incorporate Harspiel and dancing.</p><p>She nearly squealed in happiness at the request, finally she could dance for her lady again, and teaching it to her was truly just an added bonus. Her lady was simply too adorable as she shed her normal noble smile and began to pout at the sheer volume of extra lessons she and Rosina had added to her lesson plan. She wanted to see it more often but restrained herself reluctantly.</p><p>She was sure all of her lady’s attendants could not hide how proud they were of her handling of the meeting the High Priest had requested. Her graceful handling of Grammaratur’s dance was simply superb, as expected of her lady. The wide eyed stares were just adding to her amusement, especially Fran’s reaction to her lady’s lesson plan. What did he expect from a lady as blessed from the gods as Lady Rozemyne? Honestly.</p><p>She was slightly shocked by her lady’s wishes to become the Orphanage Director, was she aiming to bring the gods blessing back to them too? She sure hoped so, she would support her lady as best she could, it was only right.</p><p>And again she was proven correct in her assumptions. Her lady not only brought food and new clothing for the poor orphans left in the orphanage, she even organized work for them, aiming to make the orphanage fully self-sufficient. Her grace simply knew no bounds, even if she tried to hide her magnanimity behind the veil of profit. It was obvious for anyone to see at this point that she truly was a saint, sent by the gods to ease their suffering.</p><p>As Schutzaria picked up her shield, in the middle of the Harvest Festival it was revealed that someone had assassinated the High Bishop during his trip across the land. Upon learning this the High Priest was promptly elevated to replace him, but it was the fact her lady was chosen to become the next High Priestess that surprised her. By the order of Aub Ehrenfest himself no less, was he already aware of her lady’s divinity?</p><p>She began to worry, but that could wait. For now she had to follow her lady to her newest duty as the High Priestess and acting Orphanage Director. They needed the old High Bishop’s former attendants to go back to the orphanage. She opened the door for her lady as they entered the High Bishop’s chamber to inform them. Her lady began to address them as regally as always.</p><p>“Greetings, please summon all of the High Bishop’s current attendants here. I have important news for all of you.”</p><p>Some of the attendants became openly worried, but most of them seemed to look…hopeful? She was right, the old High Bishop truly was a terrible master it seemed. She sent a prayer of gratitude to the gods internally. It took only a couple of minutes until all of them were assembled, among them was a small, red haired girl. Delia, if she remembered correctly, she had to fight the urge to grimace. He even went after children? Disgusting. Her lady spoke again.</p><p>“I take it this is all of you? Good. My name is Rozemyne, I am the current acting Orphanage Director and as of today the new High Priestess on the order of Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Her lady gave them a moment to absorb the information of her position before continuing.</p><p>“I am here to inform you that the old High Bishop was assaulted on his trip in the harvest Festival, tragically this led him to climb the towering stairwell. Because of this, the old High Priest was ordered to assume the position as the new High Bishop effective immediately, as was I for his old position.”</p><p>Her lady graced them again with a short moment to understand her words, most seemed happy to escape their old master but the young girl had become pale as a sheet. Curious.</p><p>“Which means all of you are to return to the orphanage immediately. Please gather your belongings and make your way to-”</p><p>“NO!!!”</p><p>The red haired girl suddenly interrupted her lady lady with a shout, beginning to run towards her. One of her now former colleagues tried to stop her but she evaded him due to her small frame.</p><p>She moved in front of her lady to protect her. She would not allow anyone to lay a hand on her. Curiously the girl simply threw herself on the ground before her assuming a begging pose as she began to cry.</p><p>“Please do not send me back to the orphanage! I will do anything you want! But please, please do not send me back to that place! Anything but that, my lady! I beg of you! Please!?”</p><p>She indicated one of the gray priests to restrain the girl. She could not allow her to potentially lash out at her lady. The one who tried to stop her before moved swiftly at her signal, followed by another. Together they took her off the ground and began to take her away. The girl became even more hysterical upon realizing their actions.</p><p>“NO! PLEASE DON’T SEND ME BACK THERE! I DON’T WANT TO GO BACK! LET ME GO!”</p><p>“Wait, please.”</p><p>She wanted to scream, of course her lady in her endless compassion would intervene. The priests holding the girl stopped in their tracks upon hearing her lady’s command, as they should. Even if a small part of her wanted that they didn’t, to not risk her lady any further. Her lady looked at the small red haired girl curiously.</p><p>“What is your name? Why do you fear going back so much? Please explain yourself to me, if you would.”</p><p>The openly crying girl at least had the decency to answer her lady without forgetting her place any further.</p><p>“I- I am called D- Delia my lady, I- I don’t want to go back to that horrible place. Never again! I just thought I escaped from there, please do not send me back there! I beg you to show mercy, I will do anything you want, anything!”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>She did not like that curious hum, not at all. Nor did she like the look her lady sent her way now. She sighed loudly, understanding her lady’s desire for compassion. She was a saint after all.</p><p>“...I guess we have room for another shrine maiden apprentice to join your service my lady. But please remember you just allowed three other young apprentices to enter your service. I would advise against allowing an unknown girl to enter too.”</p><p>Her lady took a moment to think it over but she knew it was already a foregone conclusion. She agreed with her before turning back to the crying girl still being restrained.</p><p>“You are of course correct Jenni. So tell me Delia why should I allow you to enter my service instead of sending you back to the orphanage, as I should? There is always the chance for you to become an attendant of another blue priest should you return to it.”</p><p>The girl stilled for a moment, seemingly thinking hard. She had to thoroughly retrain her to not be as open in the future.</p><p>“I- I was beginning to be trained in the art of Efflorelume, I know it is not much but I will give my best to reach any expectation you have of me!”</p><p>She was being trained in the art of Efflorelume? To become a future flower offering? Her disgust for the former High Bishop only grew more. Even her lady sported a slightly sour expression now, if only they could have spared her from discovering the meaning inside of the temple.</p><p>"...I see. You must have been thoroughly abandoned by Anhaltung to think Mestionora would need Efflorelume's grace for her kin. I do, of course, expect any attendant of mine to work to the best of their abilities. Anything else?”</p><p>The following moment would dictate if it was possible for the girl to stay in her lady’s service or if she would need to remove her after a sufficient amount of time to spare her lady’s feelings. The girl’s shoulders slumped looking down in defeat.</p><p>“I- I can offer you no more than that my lady, except my loyalty and readiness to do whatever you demand.”</p><p>She could work with that. Her lady in her endless compassion extended her grace to young Delia, of course.</p><p>“Very well, only Dregaruhr’s weaving will show if you do. I may grant you this one chance. You may show your worth within the next two seasons. Do not disappoint me, Delia. Kindly release her, please.”</p><p>The gray priest still holding young Delia let her down at her lady’s command, allowing her to lower herself to her knees before her.</p><p>“I thank you milady. You will not regret it, I promise!”</p><p>After that whole debacle they departed from the premises, returning to her lady’s chambers. It was time to organize her departure from there to her new quarters as the High Priestess, which reminded Jenni that she needed to contact Fran anyway regarding a possible change of her lady’s lesson plan.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s and the old High Priest’s ascension was sure to change it, because of their new duties. She was halfway through organizing the current efforts as another gray priest brought them a letter addressed to her lady personally.</p><p>It was from her lady's birth family, her mother, Lady Roselinde specifically. She was surely as pale as a sheet, her fingers began to tremble as she held her possible damnation.</p><p>‘By the gods please do not be what I think it is.’</p><p>She took a moment to steel her nerves. She had to bring this to her lady, whether she wanted to or not.</p>

    <p>After removing the fake Santa for the second and hopefully final time in her lives, she wasted no time to secretly plunder his secret stash of letters at night. She had resisted the temptation to check them beforehand in case he would notice something was amiss. With his removal she had free reign to act as she wanted.</p><p>The letters did not indicate anything about the foundation so she hoped she eliminated that possible disaster ahead in time. No robbing the foundation for you this time Georgine, take that!</p><p>The events following her assassination of the fake Santa surprised her slightly. She had expected for Ferdinand to become the new High Bishop, it only made sense if you asked her. But somehow she was elevated to the position of High Priestess in turn. Why?! Who in their right mind would elevate a six year old girl to a leading role in the temple? The same man child that chose her to become High Bishop in the last weave apparently. It was on Aub’s orders. Damn you Sylvester! She did not need that much attention on herself damn it! She kept a low profile for a reason!</p><p>Fulfilling her new role as High Priestess she made her way over to the High Bishop’s chambers. It was time to bring the poor victims of Bezewanst’s tyranny back to the orphanage, she had already ordered a meal for them upon their arrival, hopefully it soothed them at least a little bit.</p><p>She was fairly unprepared for Delia’s reaction to the news but she should have expected it. She was always very sensitive about the orphanage to begin with. At least she got another attendant out of it and she was not completely brainwashed at this point, so that was a plus.</p><p>Her attendants were as excellent as always, the time it took them to organize her sudden departure to her new chambers, as the new High Priestess, was truly astonishing. They even assured her she could just simply sit back and read to her heart's content! So it came as quite a surprise when Jenni interrupted her new found reading time. She looked quite pale too.</p><p>“Is everything alright Jenni?”</p><p>Her current head attendant simply smiled upon her question, regaining some of her coloring.</p><p>“Nothing you need to concern yourself with my lady, I am just here to inform you we just received a letter for you. I was told it is from your family, your mother Lady Roselinde, specifically.”</p><p>Jenni handed her the letter, the seal bearing a simple depiction of an arch with two small flags at the top, all surrounded by a shield and two spears crossed in front of it defensively. The emblem of her birth family on her fathers side in this life, the Thorwaechter family.</p><p>‘Ah that’s right my current name would be Rozemyne Tochter Thorwaechter...’</p><p>What did her family want from her? Did word get out of her growing fortune, thanks to Rinsham? Did they want a part of it? Did Henrik snitch her out and they disapproved of her contract with Freida? Maybe they knew of her elevation as High Priestess and sought to use it to their advantage? She had so many questions now...</p><p>“...Thank you Jenni, I will withdraw to my hidden room. You may return to your other duty’s.”</p><p>“As you wish my lady.”</p><p>She beat a hasty retreat to her hidden room, where she could freely react to whatever news it entailed. Entering, she plopped herself down into her comfy, cushioned chair and after preparing herself, opened the letter.</p><p>It was a filled with flowery euphemisms on how much her mother was regretting to have been forced to give her up to the temple after her birth, followed by the fact it was the fake santa who had contacted them about the fact her mana had grown to acceptable levels for her status just a day before his departure of the Harvest Festival.</p><p>‘...I should have killed that waste of space during the spring prayer after all.’</p><p>She of course knew she was not in the least prepared enough at the time, not to mention she was hesitant to interrupt the distribution of the small chalices, but the thought soothed her somewhat. She focused back on the letter.</p><p>It went on about how now that the High Bishop had suddenly been killed, they feared for her safety and the actions Ferdinand would no doubt possibly take against her in his new position, without protection. They further lamented her being forced into her new position at her tender age…</p><p>‘That is already common knowledge?! Sylvester! You idiot! At least wait to announce something like that until the winter season, I would be baptized then!’</p><p>The letter ended with an invitation to stay at their estate for a few days, in four days time, citing they were hopeful she would accept.</p><p>‘As if I could refuse...’</p><p>Laying the letter down she stood up and began to pace the room. This was too early, she barely had time to prepare for any of that. What should she do? Kill them too? No, she needed to join noble society so why not use the offer? It was faster than anticipated, and she had hoped to integrate herself more to Ferdinand to eventually be adopted into the Linkberg’s again. Oh well, she would simply work with what she had, as always.</p><p>‘Hannelore would have had the time of her life if she saw me panicking like that over such a simple matter, pull yourself together. You got this. This is nothing.’</p><p>She calmed down, she had to inform Ferdinand she would be away for a few days. She needed to ask him some other stuff about this anyways. She left her hidden room and informed Jenni to send a message to him, requesting a meeting and highlighting its urgency. He agreed to meet in two days time, which was fine, She was busy enough already.</p><p>Two days later she arrived at their meeting and after giving their greetings she directly got to the heart of the matter, she had no time to waste on the usual dance right now.</p><p>“High Bishop, please forgive my unsightly demeanor but can we forsake the dance of Grammaratur for the moment?”</p><p>He simply raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“That is unusual from you, but acceptable, what do you want to tell me, Rozemyne?”</p><p>“My family sent me a letter two days ago, they made their wish known for me to visit them at their estate, in two days time from now. Additionally they requested my stay for an unspecified amount of days, citing their desire to re-familiarise themselves with me. Finally they voiced the desire for my potential rejoining of the family, being baptized under my birth mother, Lady Roselinde.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyebrow rose even further.</p><p>“Were you not sent to the temple because of your low mana capacity. Why the sudden change of heart?”</p><p>“The former High Bishop was of the opinion that my capacity has grown a sufficient amount in my time in the temple and informed them of this circumstance before his departure for the festival.”</p><p>He had a slight processing error again, she simply waited until he recovered enough to continue the conversation.</p><p>“...grown, how?”</p><p>“I do not know. I was never made aware of any test or something of this nature. I speculate he was impressed with my contribution in the last Dedication Ritual, nothing more comes to mind, but as I said before, this is pure speculation on my part.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>She waited a few moments for him to fully digest her previous statement before voicing her question.</p><p>“So as you can see it could be possible for me to rejoin my family officially. I would think this also means I would potentially leave the temple. Seeing as it was Aub Ehrenfest himself who graced me with the honor of becoming the High Priestess after your ascension I am unsure what would happen. Could you please enlighten me on this matter, High Bishop?”</p><p>Ferdinand simply began tapping his temple.</p><p>“I will bring it to his attention post-haste, do inform me should you really leave the temple, but I do not think this will pose much of a problem for you. We will simply find someone else to fill your positions if such a thing does happen.”</p><p>“I see, that is good to know. Now regarding the orphanage, I invested my personal fortune to build a functioning workshop there, which produces the current bulk of its self-sustainability. I am willing to let it remain as is, and donate an appropriate percentage to the temple, but the main share of the profits will flow directly back to me. This is the current case of procedure that was agreed on from all involved parties. Is that still acceptable or do we need to change the current contracts? Please do think about this until my return, High Bishop.”</p><p>“We never spoke much about it after it was implemented, how much are we talking about currently.”</p><p>She gestured towards Rosina, who had accompanied her to the meeting, to hand over the wooden board holding the desired information. Upon checking the board he had another processing error until he held his head in apparent pain.</p><p>“You cannot be serious, It produces that much?!”</p><p>“Until more workshops have been established by my merchant associates the number will grow even further, High Bishop. I project it will fall rapidly following their creation though so the numbers should stabilize soon, the next Summer season probably.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“...very well.”</p><p>With this she returned to her chambers and began to prepare for her departure, the current efforts for her new chambers were on hold after all. On the day of her departure her attendants went all in on her appearance, she still wore her blue robes of course but it was the best they could do, given the circumstances. They had only to wait a short time until the carriage arrived, which would bring her to her family's estate. It was time.</p><p>Exiting the temple, she saw an elderly woman standing beside the carriage, she gave off motherly vibes even if she wore the usual noble’s smile. She introduced herself as Mathilde, the current head attendant of Lady Roselinde. After saying her farewells to her current gray attendants until her return they made their way towards her possible new home. Her growing anxiety could not be helped as they arrived. Mathilde led her into the spacious mansion and to the entrance of a room likely designed to welcome guests. She steeled herself, this was it.</p><p>Entering the room she finally got to look at her supposed birth mother. She could not believe her eyes, this was just more confirmation that the gods were fucking with her because of her actions. This had to be some cruel kind of joke from them. She could not hold onto her decorum, not any more.</p><p>‘ You’ve got to be kidding me...’</p><p>She had jade green as a hair color, green eyes that twinkled in joy upon seeing her, a warm smile growing across her face at her reaction. On the couch in the center of the room sat none other that her mother Lady Roselinde, who was none other than Effa!</p><p>‘M- Mom?!’</p>

    <p>No. She had to refocus herself. This was not her beloved mother, this was lady Roselinde, not Effa, she had to focus. She already lost the first round upon losing her composure. She rebuilt her noble facade, it was just another noble meeting, she just had to smile.</p><p>With her composure regained she made her way inside the room, stopping just short of her supposed place opposite of lady Roselinde’s side of the room, she kneeled before her in the usual greeting pose expected from her and gave her greetings.</p><p>“Greetings Lady Roselinde, I am called Rozemyne. Seeing I am as of now not yet baptized, I cannot offer you my Blessings. May I nevertheless offer a prayer in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the fruitful days of Schutzaria, the Goddess of Wind?”</p><p>“You may”</p><p>“O Schutzaria, may my gracious host of this meeting be blessed by your divine protection.”</p><p>She got back up from the ground and took the place Lady Roselinde offered. As she spied another look at her, she noticed Lady Roselinde had subtly moved one of her hands inside of her bag, likely containing feystones. Not good, was she already on thin ice because of her loss of composure at the start? Or was it the greeting? Oh well, it was time to begin the dance. She waited for her host to begin.</p><p>“I welcome you into our home little Rozemyne, I hope the trip here was comfortable?”</p><p>“Oh my, I cannot voice any complaints Lady Roselinde, the trip itself, including the company, was a delight.”</p><p>Following this they exchanged sweet talk about nothing at all, it was just the usual polite talk before the real discussion began so she simply went along as was expected, smiling all the while and giving non answers. Finally her host gave orders to change the tea they enjoyed so far, signaling it was time for the real talks to begin.</p><p>“I heard your current attendants at the temple are quite beloved by Kunstzeal, do you also share their passion for the arts, or is there another reason you choose them for your service?”</p><p>“Oh my, I do indeed delight in the blessings provided in Kunstzeal’s domain but my current attendants were graciously given to me upon my entering of the temple by Lady Christine upon her return to noble society.”</p><p>‘Why does she want to know about my attendants? I know they are gifted in the arts but is that truly such a huge deal?’</p><p>“I see, I see, so are you not particularly interested in Kunstzeal’s domain?”</p><p>“They recently expanded my lessons to include dancing and Harspiel. While I quite enjoy them I would not call this humble servant of the gods a follower of Kunstzeal for now.”</p><p>Her host slowly sipped on her tea, a contemplating look on her face, she mirrored the gesture, sans the expression, her noble smile remained firmly in place, the new tea was quite good she noted.</p><p>“I heard the temple does face some hardships as of late, have you had any troubles acquiring materials for your lessons?”</p><p>“Oh my, Ordoschnelli sure was busy it seems, that our plight was even heard by our most distant of patrons. But I cannot say I was starved of opportunities to acquire what is necessary.”</p><p>Lady Roselinde tried to hide a small wince at her subtle dig about her lacking care about her daughter’s life until now, was it petty to remark on that? Maybe but she could not help herself, the idea of a parent just throwing their child away was still a foreign concept for her, whatever the reasoning may be.</p><p>“I am glad to hear you were not affected. Do you still enjoy your lessons?”</p><p>‘Still going on about my lessons, what’s her deal?’</p><p>“Why, I do enjoy them seeing as I am a follower of Mestionora, I do enjoy her domain the most out of all of them.”</p><p>‘Me, having to call <em>myself</em> a follower of that…grrr no, focus’</p><p>“Oh yes, the former High Bishop was most enthused to highlight your blessings of Mestionora, to read and write fluently at the age of three is truly a remarkable achievement to be proud of.”</p><p>‘She knows about that? How much did the fake Santa report to her about me?!’</p><p>“My, my, I am most humbled at your high praise, what other melodies did he send your way I wonder?”</p><p>“I must confess it is sadly not as much as I had hoped, why we had just started communicating more, until he was called to join the supreme couple in the heavens.”</p><p>‘So she knows nothing more? Or at least does not want to say it for now huh?’</p><p>“Yes, it is indeed a tragedy what has happened, why I remember him patiently instructing me in the dedication ritual just last winter season. He will be missed dearly.”</p><p>They both took another sip of the delicious tea, she was wondering what Lady Roselinde would ask of her next, until now it was just useless information already relayed. She did wonder why she focused so heavily on her lessons though, was she probing how advanced her education was?</p><p>“Let us forsake Grammaratur’s dance for the moment, Rozemyne. We still have much to talk about, regarding your future.”</p><p>She simply nodded in acceptance, it was not as if she could refuse such a clear order from her host anyway.</p><p>“Then let us talk about the fact that the former High Bishop believed you have somehow expanded your lacking mana capacity. May I infer how it came to that?”</p><p>“I am sad to say I do not know more on this matter than you, Lady Roselinde. I only learned of this circumstance from your letter directed at me, days ago.”</p><p>Her host seemed to mull over her answer before making her next statement.</p><p>“I see, very well, we will simply have to make an appropriate test ourselves won’t we? I am right in assuming you are accepting of this?”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Roselinde.”</p><p>‘Damn it, I cannot refuse her and she knows it. I can just hope whatever tool they bring can not read my true capacity and I can trick it somehow.’</p><p>Her host clapped her hands in apparent delight, mentioning for her to follow, the servants moving to clear their now finished tea. She silently followed lady Roselinde, who guided her to a room in the north wing of the Estate. They stopped and she mentioned a door to her left.</p><p>“This will be your room during your stay, I dearly hope it is to your liking.”</p><p>She motioned towards the door further down the hall on the right.</p><p>“The door on the right leads to my personal chambers.”</p><p>They began moving again, entering Lady Roselinde’s chambers, it was a richly decorated room mostly held in pastel colors, with the odd painting hanging here or there, she spied an art station in the corner and a table with fabrics just beside it. Maybe it was for embroidering practice? Her host stopped again and turned towards her.</p><p>“Do not be alarmed, we will do the test inside of my hidden room. It is a place where we can talk undisturbed.”</p><p>She opened the door to her hidden room, guiding Rozemyne inside. They arrived at a small table and she was directed to take a place on the left, which she did.</p><p>On the table rested a medium sized box, it was already opened, revealing a golden crown, sitting on cushioned fabric. The crown had multiple black feystone embedded inside of it. She vaguely remembered Ferdinand used something similar on Dirk in the past weave. This one looked even more detailed than she remembered. This was bad, very bad.</p><p>“Now please sit still, I will place this magic tool on your head and it will adjust itself to fit you, depending how many of the stones will light up we will know how high your capacity is currently.”</p><p>She did her best to compress her mana as tightly as possible, maybe that would help? She was not prepared for this at all!</p><p>Lady Roselinde took the crown and placed it upon her head, she felt the tool adjusting, a slight pressure now on her head where the crown should sit. She closed her eyes praying to the gods she would somehow not do what she feared.</p><p>The startled gasp and the receding feeling of pressure, followed by the feeling of particles falling along her face only confirmed those useless gods were truly fucking with her for their amusement. She opened her eyes and looked at the gathering of goldsand in her lap.</p><p>She had dusted the tool...</p>

    <p>She had never fit in much with her family.They prided themselves for being a close branch of the Archducal family and it was practically tradition that one of them had to serve an Archduke candidate as an attendant at the very least, if not as their head attendant. She never saw what was so great about it, their Archducal clan was a complete mess, Chaocipher reigned where the Goddess of Light should reside and everyone knew it. Lady Veronica ruled with an iron fist, her weak minded husband dancing to her every tune, it was pathetic.</p><p>When it was her turn to choose a master she decided on Lady Constanze. She had no desire to be swept up between the fierce conflict brewing between Lady Georgine and her mother, Lord Sylvester’s birth had inflamed the conflict even more, and she did not even want to think about the mysterious circumstances surrounding Lord Ferdinand. The less she had to do with all of it the better.</p><p>Her lady’s departure to Frenbeltag was an opportunity to escape this mess of a duchy, but she could not bring herself to follow her. She had just begun to accept the courting of Lord Guthfried, an apprentice archknight, the heir of a typically neutral leaning family, the Thorwaechter’s. Bluanfah danced for them, she was sure of it, he would be her dark god whatever it takes!</p><p>She had seen how often ladies of her standing had to settle for a strictly political union, her parents had prepared her for it rigorously. It was expected, the norm for someone of her lineage and status. She had made peace with it a long time ago, but being courted by this charming knight made her heart race, surely she was favored by the gods for giving her this chance!</p><p>So she remained in Ehrenfest, accepting Lord Guthfried’s raffel. Becoming his Goddess of Light was the happiest moment she ever had, all seemed so bright then, not even her family's thinly veiled disapproval could darken the day she finally claimed her dark god. She should have known it would not last, nothing good ever lasted long in this land ruled by Chaocipher’s followers.</p><p>It was around that time that she suspected she had fallen out of favor inside her own faction. It began with subtle harassment being left out of tea parties with most of the faction’s members present, and being either ignored at the ones she was invited to or being showered by thinly veiled insults by those attending.</p><p>These started to become more common occurrences. The worst of them all was that petty upstart Vivianne, she was just a Mednoble but she was brazenly implying that she was a bad Goddess of Light to Guthfried, to the silent laughter of the other Ladies. It was madness! Was she that powerless already? She did not know what exactly she had done to annoy Lady Veronica, but once the Chaocipher had her sights on you she never lets you live peacefully, it seemed.</p><p>Then Lady Veronica forced that same poisonous Vivianne upon her dark god as a Water Goddess. They firmly ignored Vivianne at first. It was a white marriage and everyone knew it, she was a mere mednoble, with a low capacity at that, children were not possible even if Vivianne or Guthfried wanted to, which he did not, of course. Ignoring her was a mistake they soon came to regret in the worst way imaginable.</p><p>She had just become laden with Gedulh’s burden, finally they would have a child! She thought it impossible for her happiness to soar even higher, they could not await the days their little treasure would finally be born. The time following their elation was cut short as she suddenly fell ill, terrible fevers wrecked her body and she feared she might climb the towering staircase. Fortunately she endured and her little daughter was born safely, relief flooded her then. Seeing her little Tuuliane was the happiest she ever was. She was promptly graced by Schneeahst as the test for her capacity resulted in a most heartbreaking result. Her little baby girl had only Laynoble levels of mana. It was as if Verdrenna had struck with her thunder.</p><p>She was being forced to give up her daughter? Oh gods please no. The only way she could think of to increase her girl’s capacity to an appropriate level was to teach her to compress mana. She would do anything but that to keep her darling angel with them! She could not allow her newborn daughter to compress her mana so early, it was a trial from Glucklitat she was not willing to force her daughter to take!</p><p>Despite her attempts to hold on to her daughter, Jungereise had already danced, and with a heavy heart she and her dark god, decided to at the least find a good family for her for adoption. Adding a clause for potential re-adoption into their house should her mana increase. It was a small consolation. She wept for days following her little angel’s departure. She sought consolation in the arms of her beloved dark god, as they tried again for a child.</p><p>She was blessed again by Geduldh’s burden not long after, but instead of happiness only her apprehension grew. Would everything be alright this time? She had to prepare thoroughly for any eventuality. Her fevers returned as Dregarnuhr spun her threads. But they were prepared this time, it was revealed she was poisoned by none other than Vivianne! That foul creature of a woman had surely done it before too, it was all Lady Veronica’s doing!</p><p>She had no proof of the latter but the sweet smiles she had to endure and the whispers behind her back spoke volumes about her current standing in her faction. Was it punishment for only giving marginal support for her? Was this greedy trombe truly that wicked to target unborn children?! She had heard the rumors before but simply took them as poisonous words, meant to discredit her standing. To believe they were true was not helping her mood, not at all.</p><p>Finally, it was time for her to be visited by Entrinduge once again. It was another daughter, Little Rozemyne, just as darling as her older sister but she remained apprehensive. Then came the moment her capacity was tested, her daughter fell slightly short of the level expected of an arch noble, just reaching high mednoble levels. Something inside of her broke at this moment. She just felt numb to the world as they discussed possible solutions to take.</p><p>It was with a heavy heart they decided to send her second daughter away, to the temple this time, she would never make one of her daughters a servant, never. It still felt exceptionally cruel to her, forcing her own flesh and blood to that hideous place. They used all of their connections to at least allow her an untroubled childhood there, an acquaintance of her dark god had a daughter leaving the temple soon, she was placed there for her protection until her coming of age, she believed her name was Christine? They arranged for only the best of her former servants to care for her little angel.</p><p>They spared no expenses to make their little girl as comfortable a life there as possible, subtly of course, they could not show their favor openly. Officially she was sent to the temple because of her meager mana. She just hoped it was enough. They never tried for children again, her heart simply could not take another loss of the chance to become Wiegemilch.</p><p>And so she lived on, enduring the petty scorn and whispers in her own faction, ruled by that hideous trombe, that agent of Chaocipher and enemy of Wiegemilch. She simply smiled through it all, however hard it got, whatever was said, she endured it all.</p><p>Seeing her little Tuuliane being baptized under another hurt so much, she could only smile at her lost daughter. She had met with her often, as often as she could get away with anyway. She made sure she loved her with all of her heart, but it was simply not the same. She was not her Wiegemilch, never saw the most important moments of her life, at best she was the estranged aunt that visited often. The cracks in her heart widened as Dregarnuhr worked her weave.</p><p>It was with a heavy heart she opened the letter the High Bishop had sent her, she was slightly apprehensive about the man, seeing as he was the little brother of that woman. Still it was unusual to send a message about anything to her so she began to read.</p><p>Her eyes becoming wide the more she read on, her daughter was this talented? A genius? Ah, it was balm for her broken heart, at least her daughter was happy there and well looked after. But it was the next part that made her stop, likely even letting out a gasp, but she could not help herself if what was written here was the truth then…</p><p>She had a chance! It seemed the gods themselves had blessed her daughter as she filled so many chalices in her first dedication ritual the High Bishop suspected she had even more mana than was expected of her status. If this was true then…</p><p>She could become her Wiegemilch!? No more finding reasons not to see her daughter any more! She wept tears of joy at the news, she had to tell her dark god immediately! They had to prepare so many things. There was so much to do, she could not wait to finally have the chance to become what she thought was lost to her! The gods did not curse her after all!?</p><p>It was another shock as her dark god brought up that their daughter might not want anything to do with them, the mere thought chilled her like Schneeahst himself had descended. NO! She would do anything! Her little girl had to accept her, she couldn't take losing her, not again, please no! He also informed her the current High Bishop was found assassinated just a few hours ago. He was part of the reinforcements requested to the site and saw it with his very own eyes.</p><p>Maybe Lord Ferdinand had a hand in this? His distaste for Veronica and her ilk, which she was officially part of, was no secret at all and with him being announced as the next replacement as High Bishop would surely mean nothing good for her daughter. By the supreme couple, the Aub even announced her daughter was to take on his old role as the new High Priestess at her age. She was not even baptized yet! Why did he announce this openly! Was it another slight from the old Trombe against them?!</p><p>Wait could that mean...her little girl was in danger! They had to act even faster now. She penned a letter to her daughter immediately, doing her best to pour her feelings into it, requesting a meeting in four days time at their mansion. She waited in anticipation for the reply, and as it finally arrived with a positive confirmation she nearly jumped from joy in her happiness. It was not a rejection! She had a chance!</p><p>On the day of her visit she did her best to hide her feelings, it would not do to overwhelm her little darling with the affection of someone who was essentially a stranger to her. She still could not help herself as she laid eyes upon her entrance inside of their room.</p><p>Her little girl was simply so adorable, how her eyes widened slightly upon seeing her, maybe she could remember her or felt an instant connection? Ah, she had to focus on her daughter who was giving her greetings now.</p><p>“Greetings Lady Roselinde, I am called Rozemyne. Seeing I am as of now not yet baptized, I cannot offer you my Blessings. May I nevertheless offer a prayer in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the fruitful days of Schutzaria, the Goddess of Wind?”</p><p>“You may”</p><p>“O Schutzaria, may my gracious host of this meeting, be blessed by your divine protection.”</p><p>‘Oh that was just simply perfect for an improvised greeting, she is so darling, ah she even has her fathers hair coloring!’</p><p>She subtly reached her hand inside of her feystone pouch, it would not do to scare her daughter with her wildly flickering emotions. It took all of her self control to remain in place and not glomp the girl in a hug!</p><p>But she reminded herself to show more restraint, she began with simple questions, like how her trip to the estate went, things like that. Her daughter held herself with a poise she did not expect from even an Archduke candidate at her age, her whole demeanor was simply perfect, too perfect.</p><p>‘Where did she learn to hold herself like that? This level of refinement is terrifying. What has my poor baby endured to shield herself like that?!’</p><p>She signaled to change the tea, it was one of the more expensive blends she enjoyed, and it seemed her daughter enjoyed it too, her eyes became just slightly less guarded than before. She began to question her about her life in the temple, using her attendants and education as an excuse, it was as good as any in her mind.</p><p>She learned her daughter was not really interested in Kunstzeal’s domain, and preferred Mestionora instead. Well it made sense, she heard her little girl had asked for books at the tender age of four, a true genius indeed. But that one answer to her question…</p><p>“Oh my, Ordoschnelli sure was busy it seems, that our plight was even heard by our most distant of patrons. But I cannot say I was starved of opportunities to acquire what is necessary.”</p><p>That one hurt, quite a bit in fact, she could not suppress her wince upon hearing how her daughter thought about her family, about her.</p><p>She even began questioning about how much she was told from the now deceased High Bishop, one thing was made ultimately clear. Her daughter did not trust in her good intentions, not at all. It broke her heart all over again, but in her mind she knew it was only natural, expected, but it still hurt to be so clearly stated by her daughter.</p><p>She steeled herself once more, she had originally intended to wait until tomorrow for this, but the talks were coming to a close. She had to make sure her heart would not be broken even further upon realizing all this was just a sweet lie by that little brother of a trombe. Another plot to break her even further by building up her hopes of regaining one of her daughters, just to cruelly smash it by discovering she was still too low in her mana capacity.</p><p>She ended their dance of Grammaratur, focusing maybe a bit forcefully on doing a test right now, but she simply had to know. Guiding her little angel through the estate did much to calm her stirring emotions. It was not until they arrived inside of her hidden room, and her daughter was taking her place in the offered seat that she realized her little darling had a worried expression on her face now.</p><p>Was she scared of the consequences if her mana was not high enough? She had nothing to worry about, she was at an age where she could softly introduce her to compression, if she was willing to take her offer. Should she refuse...She would simply have to accept it and let go.</p><p>Her fingers slightly trembled as she placed the tool which had doomed both of her daughters’ future in the first place on her temple again.</p><p>‘Please do not be too low again, by the gods above, please have enough this time’</p><p>Her pleas were answered in the most absurd way possible as her daughter began to turn the ancient family heirloom into fine golden sand at a rapid pace, it took no more than a few seconds. The once dreaded icon which heralded the beginning of her misery pulverized to dust before her very eyes. It was not until her darling nervously asked a question that she was awoken from Schlaftraum’s realm.</p><p>“So um- I think it is not normal for that to happen?”</p><p>She looked at her daughter again, she was slightly trembling now, her eyes now shining with tears. By the Seven above she looked just like an adorable little shumil now, her heart was not prepared for this!</p><p>“N-no it is not. But-”</p><p>This was the confirmation she wanted, this meant she could be her Wiegemilch!? She could baptize her daughter as her own child! But… the measuring tool breaking meant she had a mana capacity that could rival greater duchy archduke candidates. Which meant…Her little angel was already compressing?! NO! She specifically sent her daughters away to avoid exactly that! How much did she compress for something like THAT to happen?! By the supreme couple it did get mentioned she had a fever just recently, was that her finally succumbing to her compression? How much did she suffer?! Her poor daughter…Most likely she did not even know what she was doing, it just got even more important she could become her Wiegemilch!</p><p>“Do- Do not worry about it Rozemyne, but this means you have more then enough mana, still I have to ask do you- Do you want to-”</p><p>She failed to voice her innermost thoughts at this crucial moment. No, she had to push on! For her daughter's safety if not her own desires! She tried again.</p><p>“I mean are you fine with returning to your family, to become my daughter officially?”</p><p>‘Please say yes!’</p><p>Her daughter did not reply instantly, as she hoped, she merely stared at her. No through her as if she was looking into her very being. Was that a rejection?!</p><p>“If that is your wish Lady Rose-”</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>She took a moment to gather herself. She could not scream again.</p><p>“I mean yes it is my wish, but if it is not yours I will respect that, no hidden motives, this is not an order just- Would you be my daughter, please?”</p><p>Her little girl remained unmoved.</p><p>“So I can refuse, if I want to?”</p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p>It took all her noble education to keep herself from crying. Her daughter was rejecting her after all. She approached her too late, maybe she was too forceful? Whatever it was, she had just lost her last chance at finally being a mother. She slowly moved to take her seat at the table. She did not even care enough anymore to uphold the natural grace that was expected of her. What did it matter in the end, she was a failure as a lady, a woman and as a mother. Wait she could wallow in self pity later she at least had to warn her little angel about the danger of her compression, even if she would never be her daughter officially.</p><p>“Rozemyne about your man-”</p><p>“That is fine with me then.”</p><p>She did a double take, did her ears deceive her? Was it a final trick by the gods to make her feel even worse? Why give her hope just to snatch it away like Geduldh from the supreme couple during winter. But just in case it was not a prank of the gods, she looked at her daughter again and asked.</p><p>“You- you mean you agree to becoming my daughter? For me to become your Wiegemilch? To be baptized under me as my daughter this coming summer?”</p><p>“Yes…Mother.”</p><p>Her heart soared at her daughter’s declaration, she knew it was not complete acceptance but she did not care, she was her mother, her Wiegemilch! Finally!? She could not hold back her tears anymore. But unlike the tears of despair these were of joy at being accepted, or at least given a chance.</p><p>She tried to compose herself again. She still had things to do. First she needed to make sure news of her daughter’s mana capacity never reaches that blasted Chaocipher in the heavens. She knew what happened to exceptional people in Ehrenfest. She would not let her daughter become another Ferdinand.</p><p>She was taken out from her thoughts as she registered her daughter had left her chair and moved in front of her. Those shining golden eyes still held a hint of suspicion but she was clearly giving her a chance at least. She stretched her tiny little arms at her. Was that her daughter requesting a hug?!?! She stared in disbelief at this adorable girl she was allowed to call her daughter now.</p><p>“I- I wan- I mean to say- can- can I get a hu-?”</p><p>She didn’t even wait for her daughter to finish her sentence. Moving faster than Steifebrise she threw her arms around her little girl, her heart soaring once more as she finally had the chance to take one of her daughters into her arms, it was bliss. Her small hands returned the embrace in kind and she could hear tiny sobs coming from her little angel as well, combining with her own. They stayed like that for gods know how long, their tears washing away all the pain she had experienced in the duration of their talks before. After a while she heard her daughter’s bell-like voice, speaking in an obvious raw quality from all their crying. Maybe it was her mind playing a trick on her but she would swear until she died she heard the tiniest of whispers.</p><p>
  <em>“I m-missed you so m-much mom!”</em>
</p><p>She squeezed her little darling even harder. They stayed like that until she noticed her daughter had cried herself to sleep, she only held her even more close, if that was possible, now she was content. She placed a soft kiss on her forehead, her daughter snuggling into her, seeking her warmth. Finally she had become her Wiegemilch. She would never let go, never again.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>She awoke with a start. When had she fallen asleep? Ah yes she hugged this weave’s Effa, now lady Roselinde, and lost the hold on her emotions, she even cried. How embarrassing.</p><p>‘Ah, I broke down and cried... how unsightly. Still this bed is really comfy. I wonder what... wait... BWUH?!’</p><p>She realized her cushion was breathing! Wait what?</p><p>“Ah dearest daughter are you awake? Forgive me but I couldn't help myself.”</p><p>Her new mother was still hugging her, she was holding her in her arms just like she did in her last life as a small girl, where they were still commoners. Rozemyne’s head laid comfortably atop her mothers bosom, her mothers left hand moving through her hair in comforting strokes while she hummed a comforting lullaby. It was so warm...Maybe she could just indulge in this? Just a little bit more? Yes, just a little, tiny bit more would not hurt. Right? She closed her eyes again, snuggling into her mother, who began to sigh in happiness.</p><p>Yes she would not think about that for now and just enjoy the feeling, it had been more than a decade she was held like this. Just simply being held lovingly as a child by her mother. Even if she did not deserve to be loved like this anymore, she would be selfish once more and simply enjoy anything freely offered. It was so, so warm... she felt herself drift off again.</p><p>The next time she awoke she dimly became aware there were voices speaking in hushed tones. She was still being embraced so it was probably fine. She began to focus on the voices.</p><p>“And I will tell you again, lower your voice Guthfried. What if you wake our little darling up, hmm?”</p><p>“But she is just so adorable, my love! Just look at her, how am I supposed to hold myself back if the first thing I see is the love of my life holding one of our daughters like that?! That is just unfair! A crime! You cannot expect me to simply stand here in silence while you indulge yourself like that. I want to hold and pet her head too!”</p><p>“Pst, be quieter you silly man! You're gonna wake her up!”</p><p>“But Roselinde…”</p><p>Ah it seemed even being nobles did not change her parents much, maybe she feared for nothing after all. But should she simply accept all of this? Eh, she already accepted Effa’s affection, she would simply take it at face value, should the worst happen there were always her plans for the future.</p><p>“I am already awake, mother”</p><p>Her mother fixed her father with a heated stare.</p><p>"See? You really did wake her after all!”</p><p>Her father kneeled before them both, she could see his anticipation so clearly on his face it was almost laughable. Was he really a noble this time? Well they were inside a hidden room but still.</p><p>“Hello little one, I am Guthfried, your father. Erm- if you are alright with it I mean. My apologies if I did wake you but would it be alright with you if I- If I held you too?”</p><p>By the Seven, he was so timid! Well she already decided she would accept their advances so why not? She let go of Roselinde and slightly reclined in her lap, she looked up at her mothers face in question. She simply smiled contentedly before nodding slightly at her. So Rozemyne simply looked at her father with a smile and stretched her arms out at him.</p><p>She could swear he used enhancement magic, he got up so fast from his kneeling position, taking her into his arms and holding her protectively against his chest. His left hand began to pet her head similar as her mother did before.</p><p>“Ah my little angel is just too adorable! I am truly blessed to finally be able to hold you like this, my daughter! I am so, so sorry. This failure of a father was unable to protect you and your sister!”</p><p>Ok, that was becoming slightly overwhelming, and were those tears in his eyes now? Oh dear, at least she was sure her dad had not changed in character at all as a noble. And what was that about Tuuli? What happened to her angel?! She had to know, now!</p><p>“My sister? I have a sister, Father?”</p><p>In hindsight calling him father was maybe too much. He began to really cry now, hugging her closer to his chest while apologizing all the more. Ignoring her question, oh boy. She simply decided to hug him a little bit stronger, he seemed to like that as he began to calm down again. Really, who was the child here right now?</p><p>“By the seven Guthfried, calm down. You are overwhelming the poor dear. Give her back to me!”</p><p>She felt her mom removing her from dad’s arms, placing her in a motherly carry again while glaring at dad, who began to collect himself. She rested her head on her mom’s bosom again, she would milk this opportunity of comfort as much as she was able to. It just felt so good to be held like that! It seemed to calm mom down too, who resumed her petting of her head. Bliss.</p><p>It took a few minutes before everyone had calmed down again, her new or old family sat at the table again, with her remaining in her mothers embrace. And they began the serious part of the necessary talks. Her father spoke first.</p><p>“Ahem, my apologies again my dear daughter. Yes you do have a sister, her name is Tuuliane. She was in a similar position as you. She was born with the mana expected of a Laynoble.”</p><p>His fist balled in obvious anger.</p><p>“We…were forced to give her away because of that, we made sure she was adopted to a friendly family of Laynobles who owes my birth family quite a lot and made sure she was treated as we would treat her. She is being loved by her new family, and as much as it pains me to say it, it seems you had it much worse than her, at the temple.”</p><p>He looked away from her in sadness, and it was her mother who spoke this time.</p><p>“We are of course happy that you can officially be our daughter, but tell me do you know what compression is my dear daughter?”</p><p>It took all of her past training to not react to that question. She simply made a confused face, looking up to her mother who sighed.</p><p>“It would have shocked me if you did, you see there is a method to increase one's mana capacity called compression. It works, as the name implies, that one compresses their mana, causing the mana organ, which is the source of it, to produce more mana to compensate. Resulting in more mana overall. The downside of this is, it is so dangerous to do that it is taught only at the Royal Academy in your first year there, under strict supervision from the teachers there. The consequences of failing are really dire, going from feeling sick to even leading to mana overload, which would result in a swift ascendance of the towering staircase.”</p><p>Her mother strengthened her hug slightly, laying her head on top of hers.</p><p>“Tell me have you ever had the feeling of being burned from within? And what would you do if that happened?”</p><p>She considered her words carefully, she could not mess this up.</p><p>“I did indeed feel something like that before, it caused me to collapse shortly after I got five years old. In my dreams I imagined this golden flame in darkness, it got better as I began to press down on it, containing the fire inside of a box. I was told my attendants acquired one of the divine instruments to siphon my mana away too, causing me to recover shortly after. Is that what you meant, mother?”</p><p>“...Yes. So you really did compress, and even collapsed from it.”</p><p>Her mom's grip tightened even more, she placed a kiss atop her head. Her dad looked down in obvious grief.</p><p>“I am sorry you had to endure all of that, my darling. We will make sure to talk about this again tomorrow.”</p><p>After this emotional rollercoaster, she was informed about the rest of her family's most recent history. How her mother was poisoned by the second wife of her father, called Viviane. How they found proof of it happening just before her birth, causing the poisonous Water Goddess to be punished. Only for her to die suddenly before being able to be questioned, Veronica disposing of her pawn most likely. And how they mostly drifted along in life after that. Her family's standing in Veronica's faction was much worse than she expected. They were low key being bullied, clearly they had offended the woman in some way and were paying the price for it, currently.</p><p>Her parents did not seem to know it but maybe they had just acquired the solution to their standing through her. How ironic, they seem to only want one of their lost daughters back, causing them to suddenly gain access to a trend like Rinsham.</p><p>“Mother, Father, are you aware of what I am doing in the temple currently?”</p><p>Her parents looked grimly at that. Huh?</p><p>“Yes it was announced to the whole duchy that you took on the role as High Priestess, even if you are currently underage. My guess is it is just another slight against us to be honest.”</p><p>“No, I mean other than that.”</p><p>She simply gained looks of confusion in return.</p><p>“I mean, do you know I was the Orphanage Director before that? That I built a workshop inside of it to finance the place, make donations to the temple and take the rest of the profits to myself?”</p><p>It was her mother who questioned her again, squeezing her tighter against herself again.</p><p>“They did what?! They forced you to-”</p><p>“No, I decided that myself, Mother”</p><p>They stared blankly at her now. It was her dad who voiced his though’s next.</p><p>“But as impressive as all of that may be, what does it matter, my daughter? You will soon be removed from that place to return to us anyway.”</p><p>It was her turn to stare at them blankly now, they really did not know?</p><p>“Do you not know about Rinsham? Or how much profit do I make currently, with that alone?”</p><p>Silence was her answer. Oh well, time to shock them then.</p><p>“I currently made, through my industry involving Rinsham, roughly around 10 Large gold in profit, and no, Noble society is not yet aware of it as far as I know. So that is just from the commoners alone, the market will become even bigger then.”</p><p>Her Parents stared at her in shock now. Hehe.</p><p>“T- Ten large gold?!”</p><p>“Yes, Father. I would also like to remain the head of this new industry, I already made arrangements with the High Bishop for this in advance. Is that acceptable?”</p><p>Her father reacted instantly.</p><p>“Of course it is! I would never rob my daughter!?</p><p>“Dear, calm down.”</p><p>It was her mother who was the voice of reason again, they really were just like before huh?</p><p>“Tell me dear daughter, what even is this Rinsham you speak of?”</p><p>Rozemyne simply pointed at her hair in response, before adding.</p><p>“It is a solution with which you wash your hair, like soap. It made my hair shiny and smooth like you see.”</p><p>Her mothers eyes had become very sharp now, she could practically feel her interest as if it had taken physical form.</p><p>“So it is a product you invented that makes your hair like yours, and so far no noble is aware of it yet?”</p><p>“No, currently only the less luxurious unscented version is available for commoners. I do have a version fit for noble customers, as you can clearly see, but my merchant contacts are not ready for production on that scale until this summer. That is why it is held low key until then.”</p><p>Her mother got a faraway look now, likely considering the implication of the potential power she held in her hands now, this powerful trend would shake Ladies’ society at its core, or it did in the past at least, similar to how pound cake did. She continued her sales pitch.</p><p>“I know normally trends should go from the top down, but before all of this I did not really have the opportunity for that, so I worked with what I could reach, which was the commoners. But seeing as I will be your daughter now-”</p><p>She sent both of her parents a meaningful look.</p><p>“I do not plan to release it before my baptism, for multiple reasons. Maybe release it at my ceremony for that, perhaps giving anyone attending a sample? What should I do, Mother, Father?”</p><p>Dad sent an uneasy look towards mom. Her mother simply resumed to stroke her head, as she had stopped doing that upon learning of Rinsham’s existence.</p><p>“I do not like to say it, but it would probably be best to present a sample of the best quality in advance to Lady Veronica, maybe with the invitation itself. It would most certainly not be a good idea to give her any more reason to focus her ire at us even more. Maybe it would even let us regain more of her favor to bury whatever we did to earn it in the first place.</p><p>I am so sorry we need to use your invention to boost someone like her, but, should we not do so, I fear what even more of her ire will bring upon us. She could even begin to target you, and we would be powerless to do anything…”</p><p>Rozemyne gently patted her mother on her hand to reassure her, frankly it was no real loss for her. In the end it would become a trend of the Veronica faction anyway, this solution only made the whole process run even smoother, making her more gold in the process even faster. It was a win-win as far as she was concerned.</p><p>“That’s alright mom, I do not mind as long as I keep ownership of it, and should she attempt to rob that too it would work against her anyway. I did add a clause that if I were to be removed in any way from the industry the production method would become sealed. The merchants do not like her at all, she would never get the deal or their motivation to cooperate as I do should she void the contract.”</p><p>That seemed to soothe their worries for now, but she still had another topic that was important to her.</p><p>“I do have another question for you both though, if you do not mind?”</p><p>“Whatever may it be, sweet daughter of mine?”</p><p>She cuddled a little bit deeper inside of her mothers embrace. It was met with warm reception, earning her another soft kiss on her head, she really began to like those.</p><p>“You see, I already have multiple attendants at the temple. They are all excellent at what they do and I have grown really fond of them all. Can I acquire them to serve me here too? I am willing to pay the price myself of course.”</p><p>Her parents remained silent, exchanging looks in a wordless conversation she could not even begin to interpret. So she simply waited for the verdict. After a few moments it was her dad who answered her question.</p><p>“I do not see a problem with it, but they can only serve you as exclusives or servants. As soon as you are baptized you will need at least one noble attendant, if not more, if you're managing an entire industry yourself. Also, forget paying for them, of course we will purchase them for you. You are our daughter, soon even officially at last.”</p><p>She smiled widely at that answer. She even had an additional idea.</p><p>“I thank you ever so much, Father, Mother. Regarding a noble attendant, how about hiring my sister Tuuliane as an attendant, if she is willing? She is already baptized and currently a Laynoble, right? It would mean we could be even closer again, as a family. Would that be possible?”</p><p>Her mom began to squeeze her again in happiness before replying.</p><p>“Of course my dear, that is a wonderful idea. I am sure she would be delighted to meet her little sister, even if she has to serve you officially. We can always get around that as long as you both are staying here with us at the estate.”</p><p>Her dad moved to embrace the both of them in a hug. She did not realize how much she missed moments like this. It truly was bliss to have her family again, she would make sure to add Tuuli or Tuuliane now, soon.</p>

    <p>After a few days inside her parents’ mansion she returned to the temple. Her parents did not change much as far as she could tell right now, sure there were some changes, mostly from their new status and the education that came with it. But they were still the same people deep down, which relieved her greatly.</p><p>Following the emotional outpouring of the first day, they talked about the multitude of preparations they had to make with her impending baptism in the coming summer. The first thing that came up was her absurd mana capacity. Well yeah, that was why she was hiding that, duh. Still they planned for her to have a few brewing lessons in the near future as apparently she needed to craft her own ring because of it.</p><p>A normal one would simply be overloaded, this was not an issue in the last weave because Ferdinand took care of it but that was not an option currently, so she had to do that herself. Not that she minded, it just gave her more excuses to know brewing officially before the Royal Academy.</p><p>Because of her high mana she would need an even more advanced children’s magic tool than was normal, but she had already made plans for that, she would ask her parents again should those fail. Her most pressing concern was her current temple attendants. Shortly after her return she called all of them for a meeting to discuss the matter with them.</p><p>She could feel their unease and nervousness, like a cloud that was filling the room in a gloomy atmosphere. She ignored it and simply began to speak.</p><p>“Now that you are all here, I have some important announcements to make. As you may know I just returned from my birth family’s estate. You may have suspected it, but Lady Roselinde expressed her desire to take on the role of my Wiegenmilch and Erwachlehren, which I have gratefully accepted. I expect to complete my transfer to the estate as Schutzaria puts down her shield.”</p><p>The aura of unease shifted to dread. Why? Were they worried she would leave them behind? As if she would do that!</p><p>“This will of course mean I will leave the temple permanently. I may still check the workshop from time to time because of my investments there, but that too may soon be taken over by my future retainers. This would normally mean all of you will leave my service, and get sent back to the orphanage again or find new masters.”</p><p>Some of them looked down after hearing her words, Delia even had tears in her eyes now. It was Jenni who had a pensive look on her face as she voiced her question.</p><p>“Normally, my lady?”</p><p>She simply smiled at her current head attendant. Maybe she should have clarified this from the start instead of giving them a moment to let the information sink in. They reacted very poorly to the news.</p><p>“Ah I am oh so glad you are asking Jenni. Of course I do not wish for Jugreise to dance between us, you are all my cherished attendants after all. I was willing to purchase you all with my own savings, but thankfully my family accepted my desire and agreed to purchase you all to serve me as servants or exclusives in my new home. Dregarnuhr may not spin our threads as closely together after my baptism as she does now, as I will likely get at least one new noble attendant, but I could never leave you behind like this.”</p><p>Her statement evaporated the gloomy atmosphere instantly, instead she was rewarded with smiles and some even looked bashful at her compliments. Delia even looked at her with a look that reminded her of Hartmut in the past… She simply chose to ignore it, she had already come to terms with it and would embrace the whole saint propaganda this time. She could hardly dispute its veracity at this point after all. She began to speak again.</p><p>“This is of course only if that is your desire, I will not order you to continue your service to me. You are free to decline without consequence, this I promise you all. So if any of you wish to decline, please step forward now.”</p><p>She gave them a moment to decide but no one made a move. Instead they simply began to kneel before her, voicing their wishes to continue their service in her employ. She truly had such excellent and loyal attendants, it made her heart warm all over again. She turned towards the male parts of her current entourage.</p><p>“I must inform you that male servants are not allowed to serve me directly when I return to my family, you would simply become part of the household servant staff, still under my direct control but farther apart still. Are you still determined to serve me after knowing that, Fritz, Gil?”</p><p>They only waited for a moment before both of them nodded, voicing their agreement.</p><p>“Very good, Jenni, please send word to arrange a meeting with the High Bishop at his earliest convenience. We have much to prepare from now on, it warms my heart to have my first pillars with me as I brave Flutrane's blessings. Let us face the trials of Gluklitat together. We will discuss future roles that you may fill at a later date. Also, send word to my chefs to have them prepare a good meal for you all in addition to my usual course, think of it as part of my heartfelt thanks for your steadfast loyalty.”</p><p>Maybe she laid that one on too thick? Delia wasn’t the only one who had tears in her eyes now, oh well. She dismissed them all after informing them she would remain inside of her hidden room until tomorrow to rest and made her way towards it. She had to accelerate some of her side projects now. Stepping inside, she closed the entrance and moved to sit at her favorite chair once again.</p><p>She took mental stock of what she could possibly fulfill in the remaining time inside the temple, she could not really move as freely once she joined her family estate. There would be a need to set up a new teleportation circle somewhere outside the city for possible nightly excursions going forward. She had also not finished all of her bloody carnivals yet, the fiend who wrecked her book room, and helped in stealing her bible still walked around unimpeded. Poor brother Egmont simply had to wait for his turn, she feared. Sad circumstances indeed. Which left her with just the small stuff. She eyed her last remaining stealth outfit, the bundle laying innocently beside her modified kitchen knife, maybe…?</p><p>No it was ridiculous to target a man just for being an inconvenience in her past life. Still his actions had hurt Lutz and put her in danger too. She would not kill him then but she was curious if she could find something incriminating in his house. He had to have records of previous crimes, she reasoned. Yes, she would pay him a visit tonight and search his ledgers, or whatever he used. It would most likely be the last time she could stretch her legs for some time except the trip for a new teleport position so why the hell not?</p><p>She stood up and moved towards the small couch she had commissioned to lay down until night had fallen, better to rest early if you wish to move around during the night, after all.</p><p>The ringing of the seventh bell announced it was time for her to prepare for her excursion. She donned her stealth outfit again, she opted to wear the facemask from the beginning this time. The sword-like knife found its place at her belt, for easy access. She did not plan to use it but it never hurt to be prepared. Reciting the prayer to Verbergen shrouded her in its blessing once more. Opening the entrance to her room she saw that the air was clear. Excellent.</p><p>Navigating the lonely corridors of the now silent temple was second nature at this point. It took her no time at all to arrive at an unused storage room with a window. Opening it, thanks to her small stature, she could easily use it as her exit from the temple. Using enhancement magic she landed on the ground outside, looking around if anyone was near or had seen her. The blessing was not perfect after all.</p><p>Finding no other soul around her she made her way outside of the temple perimeter and jumped up, landing on the roof of a nearby building. She began jumping from roof to roof, making her way to her target's location, periodically making sure no one on knight patrol riding a highbeast saw her advance. There was none to see at all. It took her only a few minutes of travel to reach her destination.</p><p>Looking around the building she spied one of the windows in the upper floors still open, likely for more air circulation. Backing up a bit on the roof she was currently nesting herself on, she began a slight sprint, jumping off the roof and across the street, landing in a crouch on the windowsill. Luckily, Verbergen’s blessing muffled the sound she would have made with this stunt completely, she began to scan the room she had before her now.</p><p>It looked like a bedroom, combined with an office. Perfect. Getting off the windowsill she entered the room proper, and began to move towards the corner of the room on her right. She placed the first part of the area silencing tool she had prepared just for such an occasion. The tool would muffle any sound made in its range, allowing her to search the desk without alerting the person currently sleeping atop of the bed inside the room. She placed the other parts in every corner until finally placing the central piece in the middle of the room, before channeling her mana inside of it, causing the familiar translucent blue walls to be erected.</p><p>She began to make her way towards the lone figure atop the bed and began her prayer to Schlaftraum, it was maybe overkill considering the field she just erected but better safe than sorry. The soft glitter leaving her improvised noble ring settled on the figure, ensuring her prayer took effect. Now then, it was time for the price she did all of that for. She turned towards the desk she saw earlier.</p><p>As she began to take a look through the countless documents she could only frown about the sheer mass of crimes this scumbag had done over the years, from paid murders, to simple theft, everything was present. The most disturbing fact she discovered was the man had built a booming network to smuggle poison to whoever was willing to pay for it. Naturally his clientele was mostly nobles from the Veronica faction, but some merchants had entries too. Hmpf.</p><p>It wasn't until she arrived at the fourth board containing a list of names, all buyers of poison, that she stopped in her tracks. This name, Lady Vivianne… Was that not the name of her fathers second wife who poisoned her mother? She checked again and indeed, the poison ordered and delivered was one of the more niche poisons to target a pregnant woman, it was not deadly for the woman but heavily complicated the whole pregnancy, if she remembered what she read in a book once right.</p><p>White hot anger began to bubble to the surface of her thoughts. This vermin had supplied Vivianne with the supplies needed to poison her mother. Resulting in not only endangering her own life, but more importantly it was the reason her angel of a sister Tuuli was low in capacity, resulting in her adoption to another family, hurting her mother more in the process too.<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
She began to pack all of the documentation into a sack she had taken with her, she could read the rest later, she had other things to do now. Finishing the task she simply laid the filled bag against the wall beside the open window. Taking out the rope she had prepared in case she would have to climb, she moved towards the bed and began to systematically bind the man's hands behind his back. Followed with his feet being bound as well.</p><p>Having now successfully restrained the vermin of a man to her satisfaction, she used enhancement magic again, lifting his slumped form out of the bed before giving a hard slap in the face. The power of her hit woke him with a pained yelp and threw him to the ground at her feet. He wiggled around for a bit before realizing  his position and becoming as stiff as a board of wood.</p><p>She used her foot to turn his body around so that she could look at his face. At first it had a nervous look but as soon as he saw who actually took him captive it bloomed into confusion.</p><p>“Wha- a kid? Who the fuck are you? What do you want from me?”</p><p>She silently drew her blade, letting the metal reflect the moonlight just below his eyes. They focused on her weapon as sweat started to form on his face, which had taken a fearful expression now.</p><p>“Wait, wait, wait, calm down!”</p><p>She let him sweat in silence a little bit more, before finally beginning to talk at the trash at her feet.</p><p>“Verdrenna has seen fit to send me to deliver her punishment. I take it, you know why I am here, Wolf?”</p><p>“A girl? Y- you're a n-noble?! No! Wait! I mean please wait! I don't know what you mean milady!”</p><p>She lifted her right foot and stomped it atop of his lower leg, resulting in a sickening crunch as her enhanced kick turned the bones in his leg to splinters, making him howl in pain, beginning to convulse on the ground. She simply stared at him for a few moments, letting his pained sobbing grow into a pitiful whimper.</p><p>“Ple- please no! I’m sorry! What’ver I did? Please spare me milady!”</p><p>“So you do not even know of your slight against Gebordnung? Truly a pity.”</p><p>She angled her blade and pierced his left thigh next, turning the blade for good measure before removing it from her victim's body. She had missed his artery on purpose, she did not want him to bleed out just yet.</p><p>She moved slightly towards him and repeated her stabbing, this time in his right shoulder, pinning him to the floor as his begging for mercy continued. Too bad. She was just fresh out of mercy. No one hurts her Sister! She lifted her right foot again and used it to turn his face sideways to the ground, pinning him by his jaw. The looks of panic directed her way were slightly cathartic. She had no opportunity to see the looks of her enemies in the past, given the circumstances. It was a new experience for her.</p><p>“Do you know how much your business under Verbergen's shroud did to my family? Hmm? How much my Geduldh suffered because of Chaocipher's poisons you supplied?”</p><p>“I dn- mento-”<br />
She increased the pressure on his face slightly to stop his whimpering.</p><p>“Of course you don’t. You did not care either, so why should I care what happens to you now, I wonder?”</p><p>She increased the pressure until she heard the satisfying snap of his bones breaking, before removing her foot from his now broken jaw. She stabbed his left arm next, resulting in a wet garble from him.</p><p>She began sending a prayer up to Heilschmerz, the glittering light escaping her ring fell upon the mangled body of Wolf, causing his wounds to close and any broken bones to mend themselves. His screams of pain turned to terror instead, which she quickly returned to pained ones with another stab, cutting his nose clean off. If not for her silencing tool the screams would have surely been heard in the next block. She kicked him in the stomach to silence his irritating screams. They were too loud for her taste.</p><p>“The two of us will be having so much fun as Drehgarnuhr spins her threads. Oh, but do not worry. I will make sure you do not ascend to the heights. Yet. We still have so much to talk about, you and I. Rejoice, your input is not even necessary for it. Simply sit back, relax and enjoy the show. Ah, silly me. I nearly forgot, do not worry about waking your neighbors with your cries. I made sure you can scream to your heart's content without anyone hearing you beyond this room. Is that not simply wonderful? We will just heal you again and again, until you finally learn your lesson.”</p><p>She finished her rant with another stab at his arm, slightly lower than her first. It would be a long night indeed. She would make sure of that. She kicked him in his side to turn his body around, the sudden movement caused his bleeding stump to spray blood onto her facemask.</p><p>“Aw look what you did, because of you I am dirty now too, You're really like Ewigeliebe in summer, aren't you?”</p><p>“P-please h-h-have mer-cy milady, I beg of you! No more, please!”</p><p>“Denied.”</p><p>She stepped on his bound hands next, with a stomp. The force disfiguring the appendage to a bloody pulp and denting the ground slightly. Yeah, too much force, she would simply take this opportunity to refine her control. Another stomp  unto his lower arms only broke his arms. Much better. She healed Wolf again. His look of horror was simply a delight. She had so much still to test before the night ended, she had only just begun.<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
*<br />
After Wolf’s demise she cleaned the place up with a simple waschen prayer, before repeating the action on herself to remove any blood still clinging to her. She used the bed cover to mantle the bled out body. It looked like a mummy now, she mused. She gathered up the silencing tool, before moving towards the window she looked around outside to check if any knights were in the vicinity or if some other witness was in the area. Seeing none, she moved towards her victim again. Taking hold of the corpse and slinging it onto her back she moved towards the window again and summoned her highbeast, to hover just before the window. She opened the back and threw her baggage unceremoniously inside of it.</p><p>Afterwards she commanded it to turn slightly so she could board her transport herself, taking the bag of documents with her before entering herself. She moved her ride towards the forest bordering the city and flew for a few miles, just to make sure. She spied a small clearing and began her descent.</p><p>After landing she exited her ride and after unloading the corpse, she simply dumped it on the cold forest ground beneath a tree. Maybe it would be found eventually or more likely some feybeast would get a meal out of it, she didn’t really care. Leaving the corpse behind her, she boarded her highbeast again to begin the trip back to the city.</p><p>Landing on a roof just behind the walls she exited again and looked around. Just how lax was security that she could simply leave and enter the city with a highbeast without any patrol picking up on it? She simply thanked Greifechan for the obvious blessing. Using enhancement magic again, she began her trek across the roofs, back towards the temple.</p><p>Arriving back at the temple she entered through the window and stalked her way to her chambers, before entering her hidden room, undetected. After going in, she laid the bag holding the evidence beneath her desk. She then stripped out of her stealth outfit, stashing it in the corner of her room, together with her blade and other equipment. She cast another waschen upon them and herself just in case, the action causing her ring to disintegrate to golden sand. So much for that.</p><p>She dressed herself back into her normal underclothes and shrine maiden garb before laying back onto her comfortable couch. She closed her eyes once again for more rest. Her attendants would wake her soon after all.</p>

    <p>After her recent nightly excursion she left her hidden room and her attendants prepared her for the day. After having breakfast she was again told she could simply sit back after her lessons, it was more free reading time!</p><p>It was around the fourth bell when she received word, Ferdinand set the meeting to be in three days from now. It was faster than she expected from him, but better to get it out of the way quickly, she mused to herself. She would simply enjoy her time until then.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye for her, she made her way towards the meeting with Ferdinand, followed by her loyal attendants. He looked kind of worn out and she could smell the telltale stench of potions from him, so he did overwork himself recently. They did their greetings and she sat at the offered seat.</p><p>The initial light talk was about the current state of the temple and other not as relevant topics of no real import, it was not until Fran was signaled to change the tea that the real topics would be discussed. She took an elegant sip of Fran’s delicious tea to fortify her nerves, as Ferdinand began with his questions.</p><p>“So how was your trip to visit your family, Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Oh it was a delight, High Bishop. My mother and I embraced our reunion with all our hearts.”</p><p>She took another sip of tea to gauge his reaction to her admission they were on good terms, after their meeting.</p><p>“I see, so you reached an agreement and will be baptized under your mother, this coming summer?”</p><p>“Indeed I will, High Bishop. Furthermore my family will buy all of my current attendants, as part of our agreement. I do hope this poses no problem? As High Priestess I have prepared the prices for each, but seeing as it is myself in essence who will buy them please have a final look over the prices I set.”</p><p>She indicated to Jenni, who stepped forward and presented the board to Fran. After a brief inspection the board was handed towards Ferdinand’s hands. He took not long to give his answer, coupled with a slight nod as he gave the board back to Fran.</p><p>“The prices seem adequate, I see no problem with them. You may purchase them as you see fit. Send the payment to my office upon your departure. You leaving the temple will pose no problem, I have already confirmed this with Aub Ehrenfest. But first I was instructed to inquire about the circumstances of their sudden request for your return.”</p><p>She took another sip of tea, how should she go about this? She could simply say her parents heard about Rinsham and wanted part of it, but that was unrealistic. None of the nobility had heard of it so far and her parents were Archnobles, money was no important matter for them. She suddenly got an idea, yes that would work.</p><p>“It is a simple matter really, High Bishop. As you know I am just at the right age to be baptized, additionally my parents failed to welcome Entrinduge after me and now seek to establish me as the family’s heir. It did help that my mana capacity truly did grow to an appropriate level. I trust you remember my sudden collapse in the past? I was informed it was the result of unconscious compression. It was just an unfortunate combination of circumstances, and my parents have already acted as my Anhaltung on the potential consequences.”</p><p>“So you truly did compress, it is fortunate you were warned and it will not happen again, the dangers are much too great after all.”</p><p>She simply let him interpret her silence as agreement as she took another sip. She would not stop compressing, she was simply warned of the dangers normally associated with it, but he did not need to know that.</p><p>“There is another matter we have to discuss after you stated the reason for the sudden move now.”</p><p>“Oh my, please do tell, High Bishop.”</p><p>Another matter? What about? Ferdinand sat back slightly in his seat as he spoke again.</p><p>“It is in regard to the upcoming Dedication Ritual, you are aware just how few blue priests we currently have and even before your growth in mana, your contribution was one of the greatest. The former High Bishop's untimely climbing of the towering stairway does not help the matters either, in fact it made it even worse. We simply cannot fulfill our duties if you leave the temple now too.”</p><p>“I see, but you already said my leave will not be blocked from those occupying the heavens, so what do you mean, High Bishop?”</p><p>She did not like where he was going with this at all, they were going to force her to stay at the temple? Oh Ferdinand began to tap his temple now.</p><p>“Rest assured you will not be forced to stay here, rather we would ask that you contribute just your mana for the dedication ritual.”</p><p>Ferdinand released a sigh.</p><p>“I was authorized by the Aub himself to negotiate an appropriate compensation for your service towards the temple, it is not an order. Take it as an apology for his careless slip in social circles of your appointment to the High Priestess position.”</p><p>“I see, so the situation truly is this dire.”</p><p>This was even better than she had hoped for, now how could she get the most out of it? Oh right she had an idea.</p><p>“It is truly sad that we have reached the point where our duchy has to depend on a lady in her spring to bring Flutrane’s blessings to our Geduldh.”</p><p>She saw how his shoulders tensed and his brow twitched at her words, implying they were exploiting a little girl because they could not solve their problems themselves. They could not even say anything about it because it was the truth after all.</p><p>“As the temple only needs my mana, how about sending feystones towards my new home that I can fill?”</p><p>He took a few moments before nodding, accepting her request.</p><p>“As for compensation, since your current role as my Erwachlehren will end with my departure, I would request a few more lessons. Specifically to learn how to create a children's magic tool.”</p><p>His eyebrow rose slightly at her request.</p><p>“What need do you have for that knowledge currently, are your parents not supplying one for you?”</p><p>“My, High Bishop, I have been taught that a lady must keep her business under Verbergen's shroud lest she be exploited. However, I cannot let Ordoschnelli sing off-tune melodies of family... You see, I took over a magic contract in my recent negotiations for the orphanage workshop. Part of it was the supplying of said tools for a devouring commoner. I intend to create it myself, and as a proud follower of Mestionora it is only right to acquire the necessary knowledge. Do you not agree, High Bishop?”</p><p>He took a moment to think it over before answering her.</p><p>“That is unusual but I see no problem with it, we will schedule for those lessons as soon as possible, anything else?”</p><p>“Yes, I would like to retain the right to operate the orphanage workshop and check on it regularly through a representative or myself if necessary. This of course requires that my current regulations there are upheld after my departure, they are essential to ensure a smooth running of the workshop, and in turn guaranteeing profits for the temple. Speaking of that, the current agreements are still acceptable right? I did ask you to check up on them, High Bishop.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded again.</p><p>“Yes I see no problem with them, we will simply let them stay as they are.”</p><p>“Excellent, additionally-”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyebrow shot up even more.</p><p>“There is more?”</p><p>“But of course, we barely covered the basics, there is still the matter of regulation, how many feystones are you expecting me to fill, for how long, forging a contract about it, who will cover the costs for that, and you do not truly think some lessons and the right to keep the temple afloat though my products is ample payment do you, High Bishop?”</p><p>Ferdinand's shoulders lost their tension and he began to slump slightly now, closing his eyes.</p><p>“What more do you want then?”</p><p>“I want a duchy wide contract, guaranteeing the fulfillment of one unspecified boon from Aub Ehrenfest himself, in the future, to me and my family.”</p><p>His eyes shot open and he looked at her in shock before exclaiming.</p><p>“You want what? Are you even aware of what you are asking for?!”</p><p>She adopted her best angelica pose in return.</p><p>“Oh my, do you mean to say it is not agreeable? After asking a minor to help keep the temple finances afloat, and provide her mana, which she should be saving for the Royal Academy, to nourish the land. Responsibilities which fall under the duty of the temple and Archducal family?”</p><p>“That-”</p><p>“Or are you referring to the fact that the Aub mentioned the existence and appointment of an unbaptized child to the public? The publication of which prevented me from being baptized without my temple upbringing staining my reputation? Whatever of those points could you mean I wonder?”</p><p>Any possible complaint directed her way was shut up. How could they expect her cooperation if they already slighted her? It was only normal to ask for better compensation in return. He slumped even further in his seat as he held his head.</p><p>“I can not simply decide such a huge payment on my own. I need to confer with the aub.”</p><p>“Oh dear, I will leave the temple in just eight short days. I fear if you cannot come to a satisfying answer until then I will have to firmly reject your proposal, High Bishop.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“...”</p><p>They had reached an impasse it seemed, she still thought Sylvester came out of this ridiculously unscathed, he had no true power with Veronica still around after all.</p><p>“...Would it be acceptable for you to wait a moment? I will contact the Aub to inform him of your terms, to reach a swift conclusion.”</p><p>“Of course, may I, in return, request one of your books? To allow Drehgarnuhr to weave faster.”</p><p>He simply nodded and stood up and entered his hidden room, after a short while he handed a small book to Fran and closed the door again, he then moved to another door, connecting to his bed chambers closing the entrance behind him.</p><p>She was handed the book after it passed through Jenni’s checks and began her reading. It was a simple book about the properties of feyplants, it had the same handwriting as the one she took from the markets, curious.</p><p>After some time Ferdinand emerged from his room again, appearing slightly calmer, before taking his seat opposite from her again. She reluctantly laid the book down on the table.</p><p>“Aub Ehrenfest agrees to your conditions if we add a clause that no harm will come upon his family by fulfilling it. Let us meet again in three days' time, we can fill out the contract then. Is that agreeable, Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Certainly, High Bishop I agree to the added clause. It appears Dregarnuhr has woven our threads with exceptional speed.. Please send word when you are available for the lessons, I look forward to them.”</p><p>With the negotiations now finished she bid her farewell not only to Ferdinand but also to the poor book she had to leave behind, before returning to her chambers. She had to inform her parents about all that occurred, so she prepared the magic letter they gave her just for such a case. She described the meeting to her mother before sending it off.</p><p>Just a bell later they agreed to meet her in the temple, just shortly before the signing of the contract. She looked towards Rosina, who had just entered her vision with her harspiel already in hand, a bright smile on her face. Right, even now she could not escape her lessons to simply read. Damnit.</p><p>It was three days later her parents entered her chambers, being guided by Jenni. As her mother began inspecting her room it was her father who swiftly moved towards her, he scooped her up inside his arms and gave her a light squeeze. This caused Effa, no Roselinde, she had to remember that, to scold him about his conduct in public. Even when he showed he was abashed at it, he did not let go of her at all, causing her to giggle. Her family truly did not change at all.</p><p>It took not long after that for Zahm to appear to inform them the High Bishop had prepared a meeting room for them and was awaiting them there. She was still being carried by her dad as they made their way towards it, and it was only as they announced their presence that he sadly placed her back on the ground.</p><p>They each gave their greetings and the contract was prominently placed on the table, in the middle of the room. She had half expected for Sylvester to be present but it seemed he had simply handed Ferdinand a blank contract with his signature…</p><p>‘How careless can you be? We could write anything on it and it would be binding. That's even more proof that Wilfried gets his overly trusting nature from his father!’</p><p>Ferdinand began to write down the conditions they already discussed, it was when the number of feystones donated was reached she left any bargaining to her parents. They knew better how much mana could be expected from her known capacity. Once all points were finalized she and her parents signed the contract, causing it to burn up in golden flames, activating it.</p><p>With nothing more to discuss they bid their farewell to Ferdinand and returned to her chambers, where she gave a small hug to both of her parents, before both of them left the temple. Her attendants merely send warm looks towards the obvious show of affection.</p><p>The following days were spent with further preparation of her departure. She left possible evidence of her activities inside of her hidden room, like her blade and brewing set for example, before closing the door and destroying her hidden room, and with it everything inside. She sighed in relief.</p><p>Her parents already prepared transports for her luggage, her attendants and herself. It was finally time to leave the temple for good. She had to confess it was a strange feeling. Still, to realize her future plans and save Yurgenschmidt, she could no longer remain in the temple.</p><p>And so she left behind her life as an apprentice blue shrine maiden to become the Archnoble daughter and new heir of house Thorwaechter.</p>

    <p>As their small entourage arrived at her new home, she saw from the window of the carriage that her parents were already waiting for her at the entrance. After giving their greetings she was swiftly whisked inside, while her luggage was unloaded. She was reintroduced to Mathilde, who would be her new head attendant or nanny going forward.</p><p>Her old staff was to be assigned roles as exclusives and household servants. Jenni would become her teacher in matters regarding dance and elegant movements. Rosina, her official personal musician and teacher in music related matters. And Wilma would become her instructor in all matters regarding painting. It was practically just like before just without caring for her. She did wonder though why her parents and Wilma were exchanging excited whispers and some of her paintings. Was Wilma really that good that even archnobles were so taken by them to trigger such a reaction? She decided to ignore it for now, as potential profit could come later.</p><p>Induction of her personal chefs went easier than she would have thought, one of the previous chefs was already at an old age and so they simply paid him for his last year of employment in advance for him to leave. Hugo and Ella had no problem and were even excited as their new domain was even better equipped than anything the temple had to offer. Nicola also found her place there as a cooking apprentice. Monica took up a position similar as before, helping in the kitchen if it was needed and integrating herself with the other servants of the household, similar to Gil and Fritz.</p><p>She had plans for both of her male temple attendants, as soon as she could contact her merchant associates, they would be trained by them for a time to become her direct business liaisons to the temple workshop, or maybe even more than that. Time would tell how well they would adapt to their new roles.</p><p>Funnily enough the one who was assigned as an apprentice to serve her directly under Mathilde was none other than Delia! Sure it was mostly in the background but the irony of her closest remaining temple attendant being her was just…</p><p>Anyway, her excellent attendants assimilated into their new roles with frightening speed, surprising even the household staff who only sang their praises. Her new nanny Mathilde was like her first impression promised, she was stern but very kind to her, allowing her many hours of beautiful reading time, or looking the other way if her parents showed their affection outside of hidden rooms.</p><p>Speaking of her parents, she sometimes began to think they were just copied like her from their former selves. They showed their affection unrestrained and often, from small hugs to outright glomps at her from her mother, or being picked up by her dad. It got kind of excessive inside of hidden rooms. Not that she complained, Hugs were always good! Maybe living without children made them kind of starved for hugs too?</p><p>The second best thing was as she discovered they even had a small book room! It was just a small chamber with two bookcases and some magic tools for conservation but still. Books! Her own private library! She even got permission to use it regularly. She could barely suppress her hype, she had read none of those beauties before, it was heaven! Her beloved parents even gave her more hugs upon her reaction, no scolding or anything for her loss of composure. It truly was bliss.</p><p>Another event was their first diner as a family, with the new recipes her chefs had already mastered. After taking their first bites her beloved parents were so shocked she could not suppress her giggle. Her dad was nearly in tears from how proud he was of her.</p><p>“This is all so delicious, my daughter! It is as if Cuococalura himself has blessed this dinner!”</p><p>“Guthfried, please compose yourself. There is no reason to raise your voice.”</p><p>Her mother tried again to rein in her father with little success.</p><p>“You can't deny it, my lovely Goddess. This meal is truly extraordinary. Why I bet not even those in the heavens have anything comparable!”</p><p>“My, I am so glad the hard work of my chefs is worth so much of your praise, Father.”</p><p>She couldn't help herself but puff up her chest in pride for her chefs once again, they were truly so gifted. It may be her original instructions but they were the ones improving the dishes at a rapid pace.</p><p>“Those dishes are truly a marvel to behold my daughter but… Do you plan to publish them too, like Rinsham?”</p><p>Her mother had a troubled look on her face now, oh she was fearing what Veronica would do with something like this. She had no reason to fear. She adopted her trusted Angelica posture before replying.</p><p>“Do not fear, Mother. These delights are just for personal use only, I will only share them with my beloved family, no one else.”</p><p>She leveled a look at her father.</p><p>“Which means no bragging, or otherwise telling someone else about them.”</p><p>Her father sent her a wounded look.</p><p>“I would never-”</p><p>“Very astute of you, dear daughter, your father should have learned by now what the consequences of letting Ordoschnelli roam freely can be.”</p><p>Her mother’s comment shut dad up as if he was dumped in cold water. There was a story there, wasn’t it? She chose not to pry and simply continued to finish her meal. They changed the topic abruptly into less dangerous territory. All in all the slight drop in mood was soon forgotten and they had a wonderful dinner overall.</p><p>The feystones she promised to fill soon arrived and she filled them in no time at all. She was glad she did this inside of her mothers hidden room. Her mother simply sighed at her apparent richness in mana before giving her another hug. They would send the stones towards the temple in a few days to not raise suspicion. With the stones also arrived a message from Ferdinand asking if a meeting in five days for the first lesson would be acceptable. Conferring with her parents they all agreed and sent him a positive reply.</p><p>She was also taught by her mother how to brew her own magic ring, surprisingly she had taken some scholarly lessons in her time in the Royal Academy. She confessed with a light blush it was to learn to brew advanced potions to better support Guthfried in his duties as a knight, so romantic!</p><p>Having brewed a lesser version herself before it was no problem at all. After her first try her mother deemed her ready to brew the real ring that she would wear in the future, earning her another warm hug and praising her genius. After soaking up the affection she finished creating her ring successfully. She put it on and gave one blessing towards her mother after the other. The amount of mana used would have dusted any of her previous versions long ago so she deemed it a resounding success. Her mother was still reeling from the abundance of blessings, so she simply gave her a hug, which was promptly returned, which resulted in a cuddle session, with her falling asleep in her mothers arms once more. Being loved was such a warm feeling…</p><p>In contrast, the lessons with Ferdinand were strictly professional, he was surprised at her proficiency and asked her about it though.</p><p>“You seem to already know some steps about brewing, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Yes, my parents thought it only right for me to at least know the basics of brewing before troubling you with even more lessons, due to my inadequacy. So my mother taught me a little with her personal set.”</p><p>He regarded her for a moment before simply nodding at her.</p><p>“And they were right, now remember to write this circle on this piece of parchment, it will be the foundation of the tool you want to create also-”</p><p>And so they continued, she held back a little, so it took her two tries until he was satisfied with her work, earning her one of his highest praises. A rare “Very good”, she could not suppress a smile at that. With this, her lessons were complete, she would likely not see him in any big capacity for a long time. But it was the path she chose and ultimately for the best anyway.</p><p>And so winter ended and spring arrived, and with it she began to tell her parents more about her Rinsham industry. They had to know about it as her guardians and to promote it when it was finally released in noble society. She wanted to wash her mother’s hair, but to her surprise she refused.</p><p>“My beloved daughter, I cannot use it before your baptism. Not only is it your own trend but you have to think about what will happen should I use it before Lady Veronica has the chance to. The consequences could be dire. If you want to demonstrate it so much, simply choose one of our servants for a demonstration.”</p><p>She forgot about that in her eagerness to make her mom even more beautiful, she still had to work on her tendency to jump ahead before thinking things through it seemed. After agreeing to her mother’s wisdom, she summoned Delia to demonstrate it. The redhead was more than delighted to get a chance to use such a high quality product and thanked her profusely, even calling her a saint for her magnanimity… Her intuition was not wrong, she was truly creating another Hartmut. She did not know how to feel about it, so she simply moved on.</p><p>Seeing the result of the hair care product sold her mother on the value in no time flat. They would present the highest quality she could manufacture at this point, together with an invitation for her baptism to Veronica as a gift. All other attending guests would get a normal scented version as a gift to promote the product even faster. She could already see the money flowing in her pocket. Speaking of, it was time to summon her merchants to inform them of her new status and future plans.</p><p>She sent a summon their way after agreeing on a date with her parents. She felt slightly bad for not giving them much time to prepare, she was not even rampaging as Benno called it right now. They would simply have to forgive her.</p><p>Benno, Gustav and Freida arrived in their finest garb and greeted her and her parents before taking their offered seats. She had convinced her parents for her to lead the conversation, it may not be proper but she had the most experience in the matter so being excluded simply made no sense. After getting the small gifts and non important talks out of the way it was time to let the real talks begin.</p><p>“It warms my heart that you could respond on such short notice. As usual I will refrain from the abundant use of Grammaratur’s dance.”</p><p>They bowed their heads at her before Gustav spoke up for them as the leading representative.</p><p>“We thank you again for your boundless grace Lady Rozemyne. What do you need of us?”</p><p>She adopted her best noble pose and smile.</p><p>“I am glad you asked Gustav. First, as you have most likely already guessed my current status has changed. I will be baptized under my mother, Lady Roselinde-”</p><p>She gestured towards her mom.</p><p>“And my father, Lord Guthfried-”</p><p>She indicated towards her dad.</p><p>“As their daughter this coming summer, I will therefore become a full Archnoble instead of a simple blue shrine maiden apprentice.”</p><p>Gustav swallowed subtly and she could see Benno cursing his fate in his eyes, only Freida held her polite smile upon her confirming her jump in status. At least she was no Archduke’s daughter this time, they were overreacting.</p><p>“Therefore I thought it only fitting to formally introduce my parents to my biggest supporter among the merchants who enabled my success with Rinsham so far.”</p><p>She saw that Benno was showing signs of buckling under her dad’s scrutiny so she quickly moved on.</p><p>“Second I am happy to fulfill my part of the previous agreement, Gustav.”</p><p>Upon her command one of the servants brought forth a simple wooden chest, before presenting it to Gustav who took it with slightly shaking hands. He sat the chest down on the table carefully, before opening the lid.</p><p>“As you can see it contains a children's magic tool for Freida, just as we agreed upon. You must wear the bracelet at all times, it will siphon off the mana and save it up inside of the small container containing the feystones. Should the container ever be filled, contact me or my family immediately, to remove the mana from it.”</p><p>Gustav looked at the small tool that would save his granddaughter in awe, before sending her a look. She simply smiled at him peacefully.</p><p>“I do not mind, please go ahead, Gustav”</p><p>Upon her confirmation he took the bracelet and stood up, moving towards Freida, who raised her left sleeve. He got on his knee before her and gently placed the tool on her wrist. After this he shifted to kneel in her direction bowing low.</p><p>“I cannot thank you enough for the favor shown towards us my Lady, we are forever in your debt.”</p><p>“Please raise Gustav. I accept your gratitude but we still have much to discuss.”</p><p>He rose again and retook his previous seat once more.</p><p>“Now, with that out of the way, Benno, I am in need of Gilberta once more. Your Seamstress did an excellent job on my Ceremonial dress, even if it saw sparse usage. I wish to continue our current relationship with the Gilberta Company. I do expect this is agreeable?”</p><p>Benno bowed slightly to her before voicing his agreement.</p><p>“Of course Lady Rozemyne we would be honored to be of service to you once more.”</p><p>“Excellent, please send Corinna as soon as possible. Thanks to my new status I have a sudden need for a complete overhaul of my wardrobe, as I am sure you understand. Know that your prompt service will be well rewarded.”</p><p>‘I can see it in his eyes, he wants to scream and is cursing me to hell right now. I am truly sorry Benno but I need those clothes asap, at least you will get a premium out of it, I promise!’</p><p>He bowed again, most likely to hide his expression, citing his agreement to her request. After a short moment for them to gather themselves she fixed them all with a serious look. Even Freida’s eyes widened slightly and they all sat a little bit straighter.</p><p>“I have one more request for you. Due to the change I am in need of two of my old attendants from the temple to undergo training in merchant matters, specifically I want them to be able to act as my representative in the Orphanage workshop. I would ask you to provide this training, for ample compensation of course.”</p><p>“This will prove no challenge at all my Lady, I humbly ask you to entrust this matter to me and Othmar. We will not disappoint you.”</p><p>How reliable of Gustav to volunteer his services so freely.</p><p>“My, I will trust in your promise then Gustav, their names are Gil and Fritz. Please send a message as soon as you are ready.”</p><p>“Of course my Lady.”</p><p>“Also I had another idea for a product, please search for a reliable carpenting workshop for my service.”</p><p>Her parents sent her a sideway glance but she ignored them for now, they could talk about that later. She just saw the gleam of greedy merchants enter their eyes.</p><p>“Another product my Lady? And a carpenter? I will create a list of the most suitable workshops for your service at once.”</p><p>“Very good, I thought about entrusting the oversight of the production and marketing to Freida, what are your thoughts about it Gustav?”</p><p>Hm she seemed to have overwhelmed them with her request. Gustav began to sweat slightly and Freida looked slightly scared now? Why?</p><p>“I- Of course we are honored that you trust in my granddaughters growing abilities, but if I may be so bold as to ask, why her?”</p><p>“She is my subordinate currently is she not? It is only right to give her a chance to show her worth. I already have other plans for one of your grandson’s, Damien. The other parts of your family are already otherwise occupied, are they not?”</p><p>All of them got as white as sheets at her words. Why were they reacting like that? She was just offering Freida a possibility to prove her abilities.</p><p>“H- How- I- You already have plans for my grandson?”</p><p>She simply nodded.</p><p>“Of course, we will talk about it at a later date though, I am still thinking about the most effective method and timeframe.”</p><p>She regarded them for a few more moments. Maybe that was too much at once for Gustav? Well she could always give it to Benno too.</p><p>“Should it not be possible for your family, you have no need to fear Gustav. I can always extend the same offer towards Benno and his assistant Mark.”</p><p>Ok maybe she did truly overwhelm them, they threw sideways glances of pity in Benno’s direction who looked close to fainting now. Better to end it now and talk about it later she surmised.</p><p>“That was all I wanted to share with you for now. I pray that Drehgarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>And so ended the meeting with the merchants. Her parents questioned her about a few things afterwards but that was quickly cleared up. They did not hold back in their praises of her ability to direct the flow of conversation, and her handling of the merchants. She was slowly getting used to getting all of this affection again, it was so nice.</p><p>Preparations for her baptism were in full swing as her parents took her to have a serious talk. It was about her plans for the future, if she intended to become a scholar or something else. Her answer baffled them.</p><p>“Mathilda showed me the material you need to learn in the first three years of the Royal Academy, it did not really look difficult, so why not learn all three?”</p><p>“You…already looked at the learning material of the Royal Academy? In just one season?”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>Her mom’s stare got slightly incredulous. Her father spoke next.</p><p>“And how much of the theoretical course material that you were shown did you complete until now, my genius daughter?”</p><p>“I completed the material up to the fourth year so far, Father.”</p><p>Her parents continued to stare at her blankly. Why? Ferdinand taught her the whole academy curriculum before her attendance, it was just normal to prepare beforehand, right? Her mom voiced her next question.</p><p>“Even if you attend all of them you still need to specialize in one of them, my little angel.”</p><p>“Oh, umm.”</p><p>She did not expect that, well in hindsight it did make some form of sense she supposed. She could not become a scholar, that was just asking for trouble, and she had no real desire to serve anyone as an attendant, which left only becoming a knight. How fitting, considering the past.</p><p>“Well if I need to choose one of them I want to become a knight, like Father. I will protect my family at all costs.”</p><p>She was sure her dad was an expert at enhancement magic. The speed in which he closed the distance and took her in his arms for a hug, before spinning her around, while proclaiming how proud of her he is, was simply not possible otherwise.</p><p>Through the spinning she saw her mom holding her head in obvious pain. WHY?!</p>

    <p>She was just exhausted at this point, not only did she practically have to hold Florencia's hand through the political sphere of Ehrenfest, but their ruling Archduke had the brilliant idea to begin antagonizing members of his own faction. Well Veronica's faction, but it was his current powerbase so it was practically interchangeable at this point.</p><p>Has he gone insane!? She was barely able to suppress the loudest voices among Leisegang and now this? What in the name of the seven was he thinking?! Sure he only mentioned a young blue shrine maiden apprentice would take the role as high Priestess, but he should have simply not mentioned the poor girl at all!</p><p>By the heavens, her information gathering had resulted in finding out the poor girl was just six. She was not even batisized yet! His careless move resulted in potential animosity from the girl's family, who was just in the process of getting her to rejoin them. The poor dear’s reputation was forever stained with her upbringing in the temple being practically common knowledge now.</p><p>She had to refrain from holding her head in pain from this move. She could not even use it to sway the family into the Florencia faction, because they supported Sylvester’s reign through her as well! She had to investigate the girl's family more, maybe there was still a chance, it would not hurt to at least try.</p><p>She faintly remembered there was a poisoning incident some years ago, but she could not remember the details. Having a poisonous Water Goddess was hardly news worth talking about in this duchy ruled by Chaocipher. She would contact her sources for more information later, first she had to hug her youngest son to destress. Poor Cornelius would probably complain but she knew he liked it too. With him entering the Royal Academy soon she would use any excuse she could get before he too left the nest like her other children.</p><p>After some fishing for information she finally got a rough outline of the girl’s family situation. The Thorwaechters were originally a neutral leaning family, until the current head, Lord Guthfried married one of the daughters of a branch family. This wife, called Roselinde, was the sister of Oswald of all people, so the union heralded the Thorwaechters joining of the Veronica faction.</p><p>As far as she could tell it was even a marriage of love! Oh how she envied them. Karstedt was an acceptable, if distant, husband. They respected each other but there was no love between them. Reading the tales of young Guthfried’s wooing of his love’s heart was balm for her soul.</p><p>Strangely, Lady Roselinde’s family did not seem to support the marriage completely, Veronica even forced Lady Vivianne as a second wife onto the couple. As far as she could tell, it was practically assured there would be no chance of children either, his Flutrane’s mana was just too low in comparison. Why force a white marriage on two members of your own faction? Was it punishment for something? Curious indeed.</p><p>Just a few years later Vivianne was ousted from the family upon the discovery she was poisoning the first wife, Roselinde while she carried Geduldh’s burden, resulting in the young child being born with subpar mana. Vivianne died before she could get interrogated, no surprise there, Veronica’s crime against Gebordnung was practically known to all at this point.</p><p>Interestingly the young child born at this incident was sent to the temple, it was none other than the shrine maiden mentioned by the Aub in his blunder. The girl was called Rozemyne and had just left the temple and rejoined her family as the projected heir.</p><p>It was her husband who brought to light more about the girl after a meeting with Lord Ferdinand. It was him who recommended her for the position of High Priestess, after his ascension to High Bishop! What were those idiots thinking, elevating a young girl to a position like that! She expected more from Lord Ferdinand of all people, at least he shared her opinion that what the Aub did was an unnecessary and stupid move.</p><p>Lord Ferdinand had nothing but praise for young Rozemyne, which was strange in itself, praise from him was hard to come by and he was even her Erwachlehren shortly after she reached the age of five. She was apparently a genius, possibly on his level if he could be believed! What?! Why did he not inform her sooner, they could have adopted the girl into a family inside of their faction if she was so gifted! Again she began to question their intelligence. Now the girl was trapped inside of the Veronica faction, where talent rarely survives.</p><p>But her newest information presented an opportunity, according to rumors the Thorwaechters’ standing inside of their faction was highly questionable. Some spoke even of petty bullying from Veronica herself. Maybe they could still be swayed? It was at least worth a try, at any rate.</p><p>She used the invitation of young Rozemyne’s baptism that was sent towards the Archducal family to get an invitation herself, through Karstedt. Her husband had to accompany the aub so why not bring his wife along, right? She promised the members of Leisegang to be their Ordoschnelli, to justify her attendance to them.</p><p>Rumors had it Veronica herself would be in attendance, and she was strangely pleased recently. Not a good sign regarding anything, but she convinced Florencia to attend together with Sylvester. It would not hurt to present a united front in any case, and they still had each other if the other guest proved to be hostile.</p><p>The invitation was for summer so she still had some time to prepare, she would then finally meet the girl and extend some careful questions to her parents about potentially changing factions.</p><p>At the date of the celebration she donned one of her better dresses, before arriving at the venue. Her attention was first drawn by the gradient of blue tapestries hung above the main altar, a subtle transition from pastel to midnight blue with golden embroidery that depicted the Thorwaechter crest decorating the walls of the hall. An arch with two small flags at the top, all surrounded by a shield and two spears crossed in front of it defensively. While they were certainly eye-catching, the tapestries somehow managed to remain tasteful enough for an archnoble baptism. The rest of the large hall where they were gathered was decorated to the typical archnoble standard with family portraits and paintings depicting heroic knights. No doubt Thorwaechters of the past. A rich carpet was laid down in the middle of the hall leading up to the altar, marking the pathway the priest and the child would walk along shortly. Near the front, some premium seats stood empty for the time being made of exquisitely carved wood and fabric heavy with gold embroidery. Elvira made sure to place herself close to these seats, signifying her standing as Florencia’s Anhaltung.</p><p>She did not have to wait long before the Archducal family arrived, without their children of course, as they were underage. Even Lord Bonifatius was present, how strange he normally shunned any event held by a member of Veronica’s faction. Her momentary confusion was solved as he moved towards the girl’s father, Lord Guthfried. From what she could gather they had a very positive relationship, even friendly. Huh, interesting. Florencia moved towards her at a swift pace with a slightly pale complexion,she was clearly distressed about something. Did Veronica try to bully her even on the way? She subtly handed her a sound-blocking magic tool.</p><p>“Elvira, it warms my heart to see you again, but look at Veronica’s hair.”</p><p>She followed the directions given to her and nearly did a double take. Veronica still wore her usual veil, but her normal hairstyle had slightly changed to present more of her blond locks, which were smoother than ever before and even had a slight sheen to them! Was this why she was so pleased the last few weeks? She would not be surprised if soon every woman in Ehrenfest would at least be tempted by such a powerful trend. She could even feel herself developing envy at its lustrous shine. But in the hands of someone like her it could be truly devastating…</p><p>She had no more time to ponder this new development as the ceremony was about to begin, she took her place a short distance away from Florencia. Her eyes looked on the door Guthfried and his wife Roselinde just went through to fetch their daughter. Dregarnuhr’s weaving was swift as they quickly reentered the hall, guiding the young girl towards the altar. She was again slightly shocked as she took in the image of young Rozemyne for the first time.</p><p>She had golden eyes that seemed to shine in the light, her skin had a slight pale complexion, most likely from her continuous stay inside of the temple. Her long midnight-blue hair was unusually glossy and flowed like silk with every step she took. It had the same sheen Veronica’s hair sported. She was most likely the source of this new trend. Stolen by Veronica like so many others.</p><p>She focused back on the girl, she could already see the girl had a naturally beautiful face, even in her youth. She could not shake the feeling she had seen someone similar before. Then it hit her like Verdrenna’s thunder, she looked just like a younger Mestionora! In a few years she would no doubt turn many heads her way. If Elvira had to describe the girl's baptism dress in one word, it would be adorable. She wore a white dress as was customary, but small details let her see the motherly love and care Roselinde put into dressing such a darling child. The dress was light and fluffy, making the little Mestionora look like a living doll, with her midnight blue hair reflected in the dark blue embroidery on the sash. The frills of the skirt looked especially extravagant while still being modest enough not to overshadow the archducal family. Her birth season was reflected in the embroidery on her overdress, with tiny details in Leidenschaft’s noble color adorning the edges of the fabric, and of course the blue sash around her waist. The embroidery itself showed exquisite handywork, and the dress was in the currently trending shape, but no detail was so over the top that any but the most careful observers would notice. The girl and her family certainly knew where to draw the line.</p><p>Still, she could not suppress a slight chuckle. The carefully crafted balance was all simply ruined by the little girl’s almost ethereally graceful movements, her golden eyes gazing ahead unwaveringly. She would believe it if she was told the girl was some hidden royal princess and not merely an archnoble’s daughter.</p><p>All in all, little Rozemyne was outright adorable, if not beautiful. She could not take her eyes off her tiny form as she ascended the steps to the altar where a blue priest already awaited her, to begin the ceremony. The girl had no trouble to make the rod glow, upon which it was stamped onto her medal, strangely it was not announced how many colors she possessed. Maybe her parents became paranoid after Sylvester’s blunder about personal information regarding their daughter?</p><p>Everyone nonetheless clapped upon her successful registration, as was only proper.</p><p>“Congratulations, Rozemyne. You are now officially recognized as Guthfried’s daughter. A new child has been born in Ehrenfest.”</p><p>After those words Guthfried presented her with her baptism ring, and declared her as his daughter. The blue priest then gave her the customary blessing which the girl returned, flawlessly.</p><p>With this the ceremony concluded and it was time for the usual meet and greet. The girl held her noble posture without any difficulty through it all. Was she truly raised inside the temple? She was truly beginning to envy Roselinde. Tying her stars with her true love, an adorable and genius daughter, and even access to whatever made hair look like that. The only thing she did not envy the women for currently was the greedy look Veronica occasionally sent little Rozemyne's way.</p><p>After the greetings were concluded she made her way slowly towards the family again, Lord Guthfried was currently speaking with her father in law again.</p><p>“-to become a lady knight? Ha! I should have expected nothing different from your daughter.”</p><p>“Of course not, Lord Bonifatius. My daughter is my pride and joy. I cannot wait to show her what it truly means to become a proud knight myself!”</p><p>So she was aiming to become a knight? Interesting piece of intel, she would have taken her for a scholar or attendant, like her mother, but if it was a family tradition like theirs, it made sense. She waited until Lord Bonifatius said his farewells before she approached them herself.</p><p>“Greetings again, Lord Guthfried, Lady Roselinde, Rozemyne. I am pleased beyond words that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together and allowed us to meet once again. I dearly hope you do not mind my sudden approach.”</p><p>“Not at all, Lady Elvira.”</p><p>It was Roselinde who answered her, while Guthfried took a step back in the talks, but little Rozemyne remained at her mothers side giving an elegant courtesy towards her after her mother had greeted her. She half expected superb manners from the girl at this point.</p><p>“But I am terribly sorry, we have an urgent matter to announce before any of our esteemed guests leaves the venue. May it wait until then? Lady Veronica is already awaiting our presence.”</p><p>She sent a short glance towards Veronica, the woman was currently busy harassing Florencia again, but from the faces of the Archducal couple it would not remain so for long. She spoke in a low voice to reduce potential unwanted ears.</p><p>“How truly regretful. Might we then set up an opportunity for Dregarnuhr to spin our threads slowly at another time? In four days, at the Linkberg mansion, perhaps?”</p><p>It was perhaps a little bit bold of her but she simply could not resist. The opportunity to sway them was vanishing quickly if Veronica’s looks were anything to go by. Lady Roselinde seemed to ponder her inquiry for a few moments. Surprisingly it was Rozemyne who came to her side verbally.</p><p>“Mother, if I may. We can meet with Lady Elvira in five days' time. I planned to visit some of my acquaintances on this day anyway.”</p><p>“Very well, my daughter. Lady Elvira is five days at third bell agreeable for you?”</p><p>That was even better, actually. She had no need to reorganize her schedule this way, but did the girl just say acquaintances?</p><p>“Certainly, I pray that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>She bid them goodbye as they began to move towards Veronica, who seemingly had enough of harassing Florencia and simply awaited their approach with a pleased expression.</p><p>After a short while Guthfried began to address everyone in the hall. His loud voice having no problem in silencing ongoing conversations and caring along the hall.</p><p>He announced that they had prepared gifts for every guest, currently attending. A sample of a new hair care product Lady Veronica invented and graciously granted them to present first, and even oversee its production and marketing, as an apology for the Aub’s careless words. Causing the reveal of Rozemynes existence before her baptism and her upbringing in the temple.</p><p>Oh it was packed in oh so many pretty words but it only confirmed her theory that it was in fact little Rozemyne who invented the product, Rinsham they called it. Of course Veronica would take credit for it, as if anyone would believe it anyway.</p><p>The event ended with nothing more of note, she scheduled an emergency meeting with Florencia for the following day, and left to think in her home in peace.</p>

    <p>Tuuliane was kind of nervous, this was the first time she would enter this so-called “Children’s playroom”. This was somehow an even worse feeling than every baptized noble staring at her during her debut. She knew the expectations of the adults for her, a simple laynoble, would be low. But to be simply brushed off like this after all of the effort she went through to perfect her skills on the harspiel kind of hurt. She just hoped she would make at least some friends there, surely some other children her age she could get along with would be there too, right?</p><p>While getting along with other children her age was important as well, she was mostly afraid of her biggest secret being revealed. She prayed her circumstances would not come to light, or even worse yet, become common knowledge. Her birth mother already confided in her how her being adopted came to be and what treatment she received currently. She was also told what a possible leak could mean for her as well.</p><p>Thinking of her birth mother reminded her of the first time she met Lady Roselinde. She had just become three years old, when her mother informed her nanny they were expecting a high ranked visitor and to prepare herself to the best of their ability. She was confused then, so far she had been told no one outside of her nanny and direct family was to even see, let alone have a meeting, with her.</p><p>She even feared they would want to get rid of her, she always had the feeling they were treating her somewhat differently in comparison to her brothers. She could not put her finger on it then but her parents always felt somewhat…distant? Meeting Lady Roselinde finally brought to light why that was, they told her she was practically adopted by her current family. Her true mother was none other than this woman meeting with her. Why give her away then? Did she not love her? Was it her fault? Did she do something wrong? Before those thoughts could consume her, she was asked by the woman in a timid voice if she could hold her. Caught completely off guard, she looked towards her mother. She simply smiled before nodding and turning to face the wall.</p><p>So she voiced her agreement. The hug was very warm and gave her a nostalgic feeling, which was odd but made sense if this woman truly was her birth mother. She returned the hug which caused a stifled sob from lady Roselinde. Did she do something wrong again?</p><p>After the hug she was told she was given away because her mother was racked with fevers before her birth, causing her to have very little mana, which was that funny warm feeling that got sucked away by her bracelet. Apparently it was for her own protection, she would be treated very badly by others if she would have remained in her true family because of it. She did not truly understand then what they meant but over the years she met lady Roselinde multiple times. She always brought her small gifts, which was great! But there were no more hugs from her, which was a little sad. She really liked the one she got from her.</p><p>Her family fell on hard times shortly after her father retired and her big brother Henrick became the head of their house. He was not even to blame, she was told lady Veronica just recently tried to pressure some families to align with her faction. This resulted in them losing some of their support as a strictly neutral family. She did not fully understand it then but in essence it meant even less money for them so they were forced to make some cuts here and there. Were it not for the support of her birth mother they could have even faced financial ruin. Which was kind of scary to think about.</p><p>The situation got a little better when her big brother reached an agreement with some merchants, apparently it was something about a contract. She did not pry too much.</p><p>It was just a season before she would reach the age to be baptized that her big brother was summoned to the temple of all places. That was strange, she was always told it was a bad and filthy place she was better off not asking about. He looked really worried though. It made her uneasy too, so she gave him a hug. He smiled down at her and returned it before going to meet whoever summoned him.</p><p>He returned with a worried expression when he told the rest of the family the contract he had forged with the merchants was taken over by the daughter of some Archnoble clan… Why were they meeting in the temple then? She was eavesdropping on the conversation so she missed the name. He stated that the money would be reimbursed but he was highly worried they had potentially angered one of their last remaining allies because of it.</p><p>This worry was later laid to rest as it seemed the family took no action against them, it seemed it was even taken in a positive light from them. What a relief.</p><p>She got taken out of Schlaftraum’s realm, as they arrived at the playroom, her other big brother Damuel had kindly escorted her to it and gave her some motivating words before leaving her to enter it alone. She steeled her nerves and opened the door, taking her first steps inside.</p><p>She was one of the first ones to arrive in the playroom, as was customary as her status would be among the lowest present. It was an opportunity to socialize with people with similar social statuses and she was going to make full use of it. She struck up conversations with some of the recently baptized and pre academy age laynobles to pass the time until everyone had arrived.</p><p>It was the first day of winter socializing and the gifting ceremony had just occurred yesterday. By the third bell the playroom was filled by all the underage baptized nobles in the duchy. It was easy to see who belonged to which faction as children in the same faction started to flock together. There was the biggest group, consisting of the Veronicans, talking among themselves and sometimes making snide remarks about those from the Leisegang and Florencia factions. The latter two intermingled more due to factional politics that she didn’t have a lot of interest in. She was just content to be the one not being picked on.</p><p>She did notice one blue haired mednoble girl who seemed to be only partially listening to the conversation she was a part of. Another girl with similar features but with green hair similar to her own –probably her sister– seemed to be trying and failing to get her sister to be completely present, her face practically screaming her exasperation.</p><p>“Sister! Have you gone off to Schlaftraum’s realm again? I was just talking to you!”</p><p>“...You were? Sorry.”</p><p>The blue haired girl put a hand on her cheek and tilted her head. In that moment the girl looked like the epitome of a distressed noble lady. She could not help herself but stare at the strange sight. She regretted it immediately as the green haired girl noticed and called her out on it.</p><p>“Can we help you with something?”</p><p>A cold shiver went down her back, this was exactly what she was told to avoid at all costs. She did not mean to potentially insult a higher ranked noble. She did not even want to get noticed by them at all!</p><p>“N-nothing, I’m sorry for staring.”</p><p>She squeaked out, the other girl simply sighed before turning towards her sister again.</p><p>“Do you see that? Even a freshly baptized laynoble girl has noticed your absentmindedness!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Are you ignoring me again!?”</p><p>She could not help herself.</p><p>“Um, do forgive me, but is your sister feeling alright?”</p><p>The green haired girl looked at her again.</p><p>“Yes do not worry about it, this is sadly normal for her.”</p><p>She should not worry about it? Strange.</p><p>“But seeing as my sister is absent again, why do you not tell me your name in the meantime? I am called Lieseleta, and this is my big sister Angelica.”</p><p>“Ah- I am Tuuliane, I am honored to meet you, Lady Lieseleta. May I offer you a blessing?”</p><p>Her answer caused Lady Lieseleta to place her right hand on her face. Should she have greeted her more formally? Did she screw up even more? She was fixed with an intense stare from the older girl after her small blessing, before it shifted into a bright smile. Eep.</p><p>“Well I decided, you will be my conversation partner during our stay.”</p><p>She sent another hopeless look at her absent sister.</p><p>“Better than reprimanding my sister the whole time. So, what course are you thinking about taking in the Royal Academy?”</p><p>“I- um- I would like to take the attendant course.”</p><p>She stuttered a reply to the unexpected question. If either of her mothers could see her now she would most certainly get a stern talk about behaving like a proper lady. But how else was she supposed to react to sudden questions from someone of higher status than her!?</p><p>“Ah, we will be taking the same course then.”</p><p>Lieseleta replied with a smile that seemed more genuine. The whole situation was so absurd. Maybe she should simply forget their status for now and simply converse with her? She seemed to like that.</p><p>“Is that so? What course will your sister be taking?”</p><p>She tried to shift the attention from herself which did not go unnoticed by Lieseleta but she apparently decided to have mercy on her and did not point it out. However if the slight quirk of her lips was any indication, this would most certainly be used against her. She just did not know how.</p><p>“I will be taking the knight course!”</p><p>It was Angelica that replied to the question, very enthusiastically, while presenting what looked to be a small sword to her, much to her sister’s apparent chagrin.</p><p>“Sister! What did father say about taking out your mana blade in the playroom!?”</p><p>Lieseleta almost shouted at her sister, who just tilted her head in the same pose she had seen her adopt beforehand.</p><p>“...don’t do it?”</p><p>“Yes, exactly that!”</p><p>Lady Lieseleta was nearly screaming at her sister at this point.</p><p>“...Sorry.”</p><p>“Just…oh why do I even bother.”</p><p>‘They really have a strange dynamic going on in their family.’</p><p>She tensed slightly as the focus shifted to her again, even Lady Angelica looked at her now! Did she say that out loud?!</p><p>“You did, but it is understandable. Anyway tell me more about-”</p><p>And that was how she had made her first friends in the playroom. Both sisters were eccentric in their own ways, and it took her a while before she understood how to interact with them properly but at least there was not a boring day with them around in the otherwise monotonous playroom. That is how she passed her winter, taking lessons, learning the harspiel, and playing with other children when the storms let them.</p><p>As Flutrane began to banish Ewigeliebe, it was time to say goodbye to her new friends from the playroom for the season. It was time to return back home completely. Maybe her mother had some more lessons for her and maybe some free time to do embroidery, but just shortly after Leidenschaft raised his spear, her family received a message pertaining to her.</p><p>Her big brother Henrik told her she was summoned to a meeting with the Thorwaechter family, personally, by name! That had never happened before! Sure, it was her birth family, but to receive a summon? An official one? Did her bearing in the playroom reach her mother’s ears in the end?! Was the stern talk she feared going to become a reality?!</p><p>She was told the message contained some more information, apparently it was an offer for an apprentice attendant position for their daughter. Oh right she had a little sister, she nearly forgot as her birth mother did not like talking about her. Well it was not as if they could refuse the invitation. So she was prepared rigorously by her mother, even if a potential slight would maybe be forgiven, because of her origins. It was always better to not make any in the first place.</p><p>On the day of the meeting she wore the best dress she had, and they made their way towards the Thorwaechters Estate. She was slightly intimidated by the apparent wealth presented to her, and this was just the outside! It got even worse once they were guided towards a waiting area, she did not even want to know how much these decorations cost.</p><p>After a short wait she was told to enter the adjacent room alone. She swallowed her nervousness and ignored the butterflies in her stomach as she was led to a different room. There, sitting at the table, were her birth parents and a young girl who she could only assume was her little sister. She gave the expected greetings and her birth Mother and Father returned them with proud smiles on their faces. Her sister simply looked at her with what she imagined a perfect noble lady’s smile would look like. Even if she was really pretty it was kind of intimidating.</p><p>“May Leidenschaft bless this meeting. I am called Rozemyne.”</p><p>She finally said with a soft voice, reminding her of the tinkling of a windchime. By the supreme couple even her voice was pretty. She had the sudden urge to hug her little sister. Where did that come from? She slowly rose and took the seat offered to her.</p><p>“My Wiegemilch spoke very highly of you, Tuuliane. It is unfortunate we must meet under these circumstances, but Chaocipher, masking as Flutrane, summoned Jugereise to dance between us. Ordoschnelli has been singing the sweetest melodies of you, but the Goddess is a subordinate of Wind after all, and Schutzaria protects Geduldh with all her might. But just like the Goddess of Wind cannot shield her sibling from the gaze of Ewigeliebe forever, Ordoschnelli must give way to Anhaltung in front of the Supreme Couple too. Verbergen must not hide what Ordoschnelli omits. Erwaermen acted on the melodies of Geduldh’s love too, after all.”</p><p>‘Wait what? Um, what does she mean? Citing Ordoschnelli and sweet melodies means beautiful lies, but what does she mean with Schutzaria protecting Geduldh? It is obviously no allusion to family. And Wiegemilch? … She does not trust what our mother told her? I do not know what she means!’</p><p>She did her best to hide her growing panic, she held her smile at her sister while she thought about the hidden meaning of those words. Apparently she took too long as her birth mother sent her a slightly troubled look. She was not given any more chance to think as her sister continued.</p><p>“It seems you lack the blessings of Erwachlehren. Has Chaocipher been keeping Anhaltung from you, or is your Geduldh shunned by Greifechan? In that case maybe we can become Flutrane, one of her exalted twelve is sure to follow her calling.”</p><p>She understood maybe half of that. Was she calling them out because they had no luck? Her confusion must have shown on her face as her sister simply closed her eyes and sighed. Had she failed again?! She focused on the next words but they were not directed at her.</p><p>"Turn around and face the wall.”</p><p>Her little sister's voice had a slightly sharpened edge as it carried through the room. She glanced at the attendants all around them, who nearly instantly complied with the order. Not waiting for a moment, sure that she would be obeyed, she laid her tiny hand upon a small magic tool on the table between them. The device erected a blue barrier around them, a sound-silencing magic tool?</p><p>“Now we can talk without any of Grammaratur’s dance being necessary. So let's try again.”</p><p>The noble facade her sister wore faded to reveal a slightly sad smile at her. She had definitively failed the test leveled upon her!</p><p>“Hello, Tuuliane. My name is Rozemyne, we did not really have had any opportunity to meet before because of the poisoning, orchestrated by Vivianne. I heard some good things from our mother, but understand I cannot simply rely on her words alone as they are influenced by her love for you. It is important to listen to the whole truth.</p><p>Your silence will be taken as agreement to my statements which would mean you already confessed to potentially using our mothers love to acquire the position offered to you.”</p><p>She paled.</p><p>“I then stated that your education seems to be lacking. Followed by asking if it was due to ill wishes or maybe just the lack of funds to hire better educational means. And finally I offered our help in fixing those circumstances, should they be financial.”</p><p>So she absolutely failed in interpreting those meanings. She bowed in her seat.</p><p>“I- I am deeply sorry! Please forgive-”</p><p>“It's alright, sister.”</p><p>She looked up. Did she just call her sister?</p><p>“I do hope I can call you sister, right?”</p><p>The look directed at her struck her like Verdrenna’s thunder</p><p>“O- Of course you can! I would be glad to call you my little sister!”</p><p>She instinctively got up from her seat. Oh no…</p><p>Her sister simply giggled and also rose from her seat while moving towards her. She tentatively opened her arms in a gesture she saw her birth mother perform when they first met, and her little sister walked into them, embracing her tightly. She reciprocated the hug and basked in the warmth it provided as she closed her eyes. Her little sister’s hair smelled so good too.</p><p>Only the gods knew how long Dregarnuhr kept spinning their threads while they were locked in the tight embrace. She didn’t even notice her birth parents had moved to join their hug. There was this warm feeling, like a part of her that felt whole again. It was her birth mother that finally broke the comfortable silence that had fallen over the room.</p><p>“Now, now, we will have more chances for hugs later. Let us first complete the discussion we brought Tulliane here for.”</p><p>She was a bit sad to let go but she understood that they must finish their conversation and doing it while being in a group hug would not be proper. She sat down on her seat again, and her birth mother began to talk again.</p><p>“Tulliane, the main purpose to call you to our estate was to ask if you would like to serve as Rozemyne’s attendant. That way you can stay here with us without any suspicions being brought up about your birth. This is not an order, but a request.”</p><p>‘Would staying here allow me to get more of these warm and fuzzy hugs?’</p><p>Her mother leveled a slightly exasperated look at her. Eep!</p><p>“It also seems we have to hire better teachers for you, if you serve your little sister as an attendant. Those kinds of conversations will most likely occur sometimes. You have to at least understand what is being said.”</p><p>So she was being scolded after all!? She hung her head slightly.</p><p>“Yes, Lady Roselinde. I am sorry.”</p><p>“So do you agree to become my attendant, Sister?”</p><p>She smiled at her little sister.</p><p>“Yes, I would be delighted if you still want me.”</p><p>“Of course I do!”</p><p>Ah, the warm feeling in her chest had returned. She was then introduced to Mathilde, her little sister's current head attendant and nanny. She would become an attendant apprentice under her guidance. She had much to learn, she would give her best to not disappoint her birth family again!</p>

    <p>Recruiting her big sister Tuuli, or Tuuliane now, was easier than expected. She was currently in the process of learning attendant work form Mathilde, so she received a small room inside of the estate. Of course the prolonged stay was abused relentlessly by all of them to sneak hugs or just simple private moments when nobody could see.</p><p>Sadly they found out her education was even more stunted then they had first envisioned, she had even more reasons to make her order to Ingo now. But first it was time to visit her noble mother from the last weave. She had to remind herself that Elvira was currently a potential political enemy.</p><p>‘The pains of being in the opposing faction in this life. I swear, if my parents would not be part of it…’</p><p>She forcefully dispelled her dark thoughts, she could not change it for now. Maybe they could slowly join the Florencia faction with time, as unlikely as it currently was. Rinsham brought too much attention upon them from Veronica for a simple switch. Still it was most likely nothing more than a simple meeting to feel out the possibility of a change.</p><p>On the day of the meeting she was thoroughly washed and dressed in her finest dress. It was a beautiful piece, with petticoats in a pale hue of Leidenschaft’s color giving the skirt the bell shape her mother seemed to especially adore on her. It was much more modestly decorated than her baptism dress, but the neckline and the edges of the sleeve were still decorated with stiffened white ruffles, and a simple golden ribbon was sewn all around the edges, and anywhere the fabric and ruffles met. Her sister was directly serving her as one of her attendants, still overseen by Mathilde, of course. Delia showed Tuuliane how to correctly use rinsham to prepare her hair. It was still kind of surreal that she had her sister and Delia of all people as her closest aides currently, aside from her nanny. Both of them seemed to get along really well too, if only Delia would calm down her ever growing worship of her person. She arrived at the point of openly praising her hair, from the color, to its silken feeling…</p><p>It got even worse when her sister started to agree with her!? She did not want her angelic sister to develop a saintly image of her, thank you very much! It got even worse when she offered for Tuuliane to use it too. She did not like the sparkle in her eyes, not at all. She did like the wide smile though. Small wins.</p><p>After this whole event they went to have breakfast with her family, it was fairly uneventful. Except for dad going on a rant about how beautiful they all were. Sigh.</p><p>Afterwards they made their way towards the Linkberg mansion. The carriage ride was boring and bumpy, she could not even read a book. They arrived shortly before the agreed time, the servants guided them towards a waiting room. They did not have to wait long before finally meeting their host. While they had to offer greetings first, Elvira greeted them with a surprising amount of goodwill, considering they were Veronicans. After their greetings were given it was time for the talks to begin.</p><p>The talks were mainly between her mother and Elvira, she was just supposed to sit there and act like the perfect little noble girl. Regal and refined. As far as she could tell they were mostly probed about their current standing inside of the Veronica faction. Her mother expertly dodged most of the inquiries with evasions, while staying polite. This alone spoke much about their thoughts already, as was planned by them beforehand. They were currently locked on the topic of their home's decoration of all things.</p><p>“I must say, Lady Elvira, your tea party room is splendid. Such a beautiful view of your gardens too. Leidenschaft appears to be smiling down upon us.”</p><p>“Oh thank you ever so much. I have had a great pleasure decorating this room. As a Wiegemilch of only boys, I have such little opportunity to showcase my feminine touch.”</p><p>Elvira took a sip of her tea before continuing with the perfect noble poise she remembered her to have.</p><p>“It is not quite the latest Ahrensbach decor that I’m sure you are used to, but I enjoy it nonetheless.”</p><p>“Indeed, your estate is a different kind of beauty, Lady Elvira. I would not expect to see the same taste to be shared across every lady in the duchy. Flutrane and Heilschmerz heal differently, after all.”</p><p>All of them took another sip of tea. It was not bad but she really preferred the blend they had at home, and the boring bait and evading did not help to improve her mood either. As if her mother would fall for such an obvious trap, honestly.</p><p>“My, you are too kind, Lady Roselinde. As I recall from my recent visit, your estate is quite lovely as well. Kunstzeal has clearly not held back her protection from the exclusive painters of your family. Some of the battle scenes depicted in your entryway were so well crafted, I feared they might inspire Angriff in my husband.”</p><p>“As a fellow Goddess of Light to a knight, I am very familiar with this fear. Still, such high praise, I shall make sure to be Ordoschnelli and bring it to the right ears.”</p><p>“It is only right to praise all of Kunstzeal’s work that Dregarnuhr allows one to witness, don’t you agree? Yet, Verbergen must have been playing tricks on me as I could not find the blessings of Kunstzeal that flow to us through Greifechan’s handiwork in your home. Perhaps your house prefers the healing of Heilschmerz, after all?”</p><p>She deduced their standing and comfort inside their faction from the apparent lack of Ahrensbach influence inside their entry way?</p><p>“Flutrane’s blessings are as ever changing as the Goddess herself - often one does not find her work where one expects, Lady Elvira. Water flows even under the earth while Geduldh keeps what's precious to her on the surface. I may be his Goddess of Light, but my husband is still a knight, and quite a proud one too.”</p><p>“Perhaps Heilschmerz’s blessing is simply more apparent in those protecting our Geduldh.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but she is still a subordinate of Water.”</p><p>They both sipped their tea in silence for a moment, until clouds gave way to rays of sun, which shone into the room.</p><p>“It is as you mentioned, Lady Roselinde, Leidenschaft must be smiling down upon us. His season has been most kind to us, crossing my threads rather frequently with the most delightful company at tea parties. I am sure you can relate.”</p><p>“Ah, Dregarnuhr has been spinning especially fast as we prepared for my dear Rosemyne’s baptism, however our threads crossing with all those invited and more was a blessing worth the wait.”</p><p>“Ah of course, a young lady’s baptism is never a small undertaking. And to be acknowledged as a new noble under the watchful eyes of all those who rule the sky is a rare event indeed.”</p><p>“Seeing a child receive their medal and have the audience’s undivided attention is every mother’s dream, I’m sure.”</p><p>It seemed that even her mom could not resist the temptation to brag a little, as she added another comment with a soft smile on her lips.</p><p>“Of course, for a child as blessed by the Gods as Rozemyne, Glucklitat could not set much of a trial.”</p><p>She noticed that Elvira’s gaze wandered towards her through the conversation, more often than was strictly necessary. Of course, she had eyed all of their hair upon their entry, but it seemed she had somehow captured her attention even without it?</p><p>As if summoned by her thoughts, the topic shifted towards Rinsham. And Elvira spoke towards her, instead of her mother now.</p><p>"Your hair is truly beautiful, Lady Rozemyne. I see you shared the secret with your mother and attendant too, its lustrous shine is linked to the new product, Rinsham it was called correct? Your trend, oh my, do excuse me. I meant to say, Lady Veronica's trend is beginning to make quite the waves.”</p><p>So she wanted to confirm it was her who invented it? She had no problem with that. She simply thanked her for the compliment on her hair, and took another sip of tea. After waiting a few moments more to make sure her agreement came across she answered with an evasion.</p><p>“The new haircare product does indeed work wonders. Now that it is finally released I could not resist sharing some of it with my family and attendants. I do hope the sample given to you will bring you much delight.”</p><p>She noticed Elvira had not used it until now, but if her eyes wandering between each of our locks and the nearly inaudible sighs were any indication she could not resist the allure for long. Factionional conflict getting in the way of looking pretty was a very annoying thing. She could not even reveal that her current contracts prevented Veronica from getting any money from it. It was curious she did not comment on this so far, all of the stories about her painted her as quite the greedy person. She had to be especially careful for now. But she was getting distracted and she still had to focus on her current meeting with Elvira first.</p><p>“It surely will. Having such lustrous hair makes you look as if Efflorelume and Kunstzeal have graced you themself. It is such a shame that factional divides prevent so many ladies continuous access to the product.”</p><p>Somehow Elvira steered the conversation back to her again, what was her motive for this?</p><p>“My husband told me stories of the tales Lord Ferdinand shared with him, you are truly blessed by Mestionora, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>She adopted her best Angelica pose.</p><p>“Oh my, I do dearly hope Ordoschnelli sang only the best melodies. I must confess I quite enjoyed my time as Mestionora under my Erwachlehren inside of the temple. I cannot wait to enter the playroom myself. My new attendant spoke quite highly of its supposed educational standard.”</p><p>She knew of course the playroom was currently a mess of senseless factional rivalries and conflict, it seemed Elvira was at least aware of it too as she hastily changed the topic again.</p><p>She sighed and placed a hand on her cheek.</p><p>“How about a change of tea? Might Verbergen assist Grammaratur before Ordoschnelli takes flight?”</p><p>Mother nodded gracefully at the request to have a talk under a sound-blocking tool. Elvira signaled one of her retainers to activate the device on the table.</p><p>“Lady Roselinde, I couldn’t help but notice my father-in-law Lord Bonifatius’ presence at Lady Rozemyne’s baptism. You must understand my surprise as he is not known to attend many events, now that he has retired.”</p><p>“But of course. My Dark God and Lord Bonifatius have always had an amicable relationship, even when Guthfried was at the height of his summer. Lord Bonifatius had taken a liking to him due to his proficiency with enhancement magic.”</p><p>Mother took another sip of her tea, giving Elvira the initiative again. This felt more like an interview than a simple gathering the further it progressed.</p><p>“I also heard that your precious daughter wants to follow in his footsteps. You wish to become a knight, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>So she was involving her again, she simply smiled before giving her response.</p><p>“Oh my, you certainly heard a lot as you approached us at my baptism, Lady Elvira.”</p><p>Her comments seemed to startle Elvira a little as her eyes widened subtly.</p><p>“But you are correct, of course, in your statement. I wish to honor the traditions of my family. I did also enjoy any movement related activities before my baptism, it seems only logical to combine the two for my studies.”</p><p>“I see, are you aware you would be the only female knight of your rank in your faction? As far as I am aware there is only Lady Isoldina, and she has graduated from the Royal Academy just this year. It may sound preposterous coming from me, as the mother of three knights myself, but are you sure of your decision?”</p><p>Was the Veronica faction truly lacking in archnobles this much? Well she simply had to live with it, it was more attention than she expected but nearly all of her plans were in need of slight adjustments currently anyway. She would simply adapt as she always did.</p><p>“It poses no trouble for me, Lady Elvira. My father will be my Erwachlehren in all knightley matters, I am looking forward to it to be honest.”</p><p>It was the last time she was involved in the talks from there and they concluded the tea party soon as well. For now she had other things to focus on, like giving her first order to Ingo, as example.</p><p>The return to their estate was as boring as the departure, she really should have taken a book with her. At least she had some time to read until she was informed her guests had arrived. She decided to receive them in the small meeting room. After her arrival, she sent Tuuliane to fetch them. It was Ingo, who was accompanied by Gustav. Both of them looked as if they were walking on glass before giving their greetings. She decided to be extra nice to them.</p><p>“As usual I will refrain from Grammaratur’s dance. It warms my heart to meet you again Gustav, I do expect you have finished my order?”</p><p>“You honor us once again, my Lady. Yes, I have fulfilled your order and brought the best carpenter I could find, outlined by your directions, of course. Allow me to introduce Ingo, the foreman of said workshop.”</p><p>He gesticulated towards Ingo, who was sweating nervously as he bowed deeply towards her. Oh dear.</p><p>“It is a tremendous honor to serve you, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>‘Laying it on a bit too thick, Ingo.’</p><p>She glanced at Gustav again, who slightly flinched at her look before hastingly taking control of the conversation once more.</p><p>“Ahem, rest assured he can accomplish whatever you desire, my Lady.”</p><p>“I see, I am willing to trust your judgment on this then, Gustav.”</p><p>She then went on to explain her idea about karuta and playing cards to them, she only desired to acquire three sets for now, so they assured her that the order would pose no problem and would be finished quickly. She dismissed Ingo and told Gustav to remain for a moment more.</p><p>“Gustav, please do educate your chosen representatives better next time. I will overlook it today but Ingo’s bearing today could have heavy consequences for you all. I mean this not as a threat but as advice given in good faith.”</p><p>He seemed to release a breath of relief at her slight admonishment, before nodding at her once.</p><p>“Be assured it will not happen again, my Lady.”</p><p>“Good, I pray that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>And with that she had secured some sets of learning material for her sister with some spares to boot. All in all, it was a productive day indeed.</p>

    <p>It was a beautiful day, Schutzaria had just begun to raise her shield but the sky was clear and the temperature still mild. She gripped her dearest treasure a little bit tighter. She was currently at the training ground of the Knight Order for another training session. She was giddy for another chance to use her manablade again, becoming a knight was the best decision she ever made. She just heard it was the easiest course one could take and wasted no moment in making it her path forward.</p><p>It was practically made for her, she loved those training sessions and the best thing was she did not have to think about any complex matters at all! After seeing how effortlessly she took to the lessons even her parents showed some hope for her, that was until she was forced to join the Royal Academy. Learning all that complicated stuff was just awful, and the older students said it only got even more difficult with the years…</p><p>She did not want that! It was already difficult enough! At least she could simply forget all about that at the training sessions. It was nearly time to begin, she wondered where Lord Guthfried was. He was very kind to them all and she liked his attitude a lot, he even showed her how to use enhancement magic. His explanation was so much easier to understand than those other descriptions she heard before, he even praised her for her talent after she got it in her third try. She did not get praised much so it made her really happy.</p><p>Ah, he was just arriving on his highbeast, and he brought a little girl with him? Strange. He made his way towards their group, followed by the girl and laid his hand on her head before speaking to them.</p><p>“Greetings, young ones. This is my darling daughter Rozemyne! She wants to become a knight in the future, like me, so treat her well!”</p><p>So the girl wanted to become a knight too? And she was Lord Guthfrieds daughter? She would treat her as well as she could then.</p><p>The graduated knights began their exercise while the future apprentices, like her, were forced to watch for now. She really wanted to train her swordsmanship as soon as possible. She was distracted as Lord Guthfrieds daughter said something interesting.</p><p>“I wonder how he is this strong, my father’s last move is leaving marks in the ground but everyone acts as if that is normal?”</p><p>Ah! She could answer this question!</p><p>“They are using enhancement magic.”</p><p>The girl looked at her in confusion.</p><p>“Enhancement magic? How does that work exactly? Oh my, do forgive me, how rude of me. I am Rozemyne, what is your name if you do not mind me asking?”</p><p>She was forced to look away from the training to not appear rude.</p><p>“I am Angelica.”</p><p>“Oh so you are Angelica. My, Tuuliane mentioned you as her friend from the playroom, what a coincidence indeed.”</p><p>That caught her attention somewhat, the girl knew Tuuliane? Her confusion must be showing because she got a response before she could voice any form of question.</p><p>“Tuuliane became my apprentice attendant after my baptism this summer.”</p><p>She leveled a look at her that caused her instincts to go haywire. Why did she suddenly feel as if she was in danger?</p><p>“I do dearly hope we can become friends too, Angelica. But you mentioned enhancement magic, did you not? What is it and how does one use it?”</p><p>Uh oh. She did not expect to be questioned like that. What should she say? She could not remember Lord Guthfrieds words at all! She simply did it naturally at this point. She had to improvise.</p><p>“Um, you let your mana flow through your body until it feels slightly warm, then you focus on the part you want to empower and bam!”</p><p>Perfection.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>The girl looked away from her and raised her right hand to look at it more closely, she clenched and unclenched it a few times before turning her sight towards her again.</p><p>“So, how do I test if it actually works, Angelica?”</p><p>Even more questions!?</p><p>“You hit something?”</p><p>She looked around them and pointed at the small wall that was used for their climbing exercise.</p><p>“Like that wall.”</p><p>“...That wall is like an arm’s length thick.”</p><p>She simply shrugged, if she truly got it it would leave a mark at least. She watched as the girl walked towards the wall and stopped before it before assuming a striking pose. She took aim and swung her fist towards the wall.</p><p>CRACK!!!</p><p>She could barely believe her eyes as the girl’s tiny arm sunk INTO the wall! The loud noise drawing the attention of everyone around them in the yard. The girl grimaced slightly before removing her arm from it and flexed her hand a few times before looking at the wall once again in apparent contemplation. She took a step back and gave the wall a spinning kick with her right leg. The results were…</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>The section that was hit exploded in excessive force, the tremor being felt even at her current position by a slight shake of the ground. The rest of the wall crumbled into a huge pile of debris as a gigantic smoke cloud was spinning around the girl as if trying to embrace her, but being too afraid to touch the origin of its creation. It was the most impressive use of enhancement magic she had ever seen. It was so beautiful. What was her name again? She had to remember!</p><p>“L-Lady Rozemyne!?”</p><p>Ah right she was called Rozemyne, she sent her silent gratitude towards the green haired boy for saying it out loud. She was aware the commotion grew as the adults came to investigate but she did not care, all she could focus on was trying to burn the image of Lady Rozemynes figure as she kicked the wall into her mind.</p><p>She needed to talk with her again, maybe she could ask her this time how she did that! She did not even mind that the exercise was canceled before she could get a turn to practice. It was only after she returned home and spoke with her sister that she was taken out of her daydreams.</p><p>“Wait… what did you just say, sister?”</p><p>Her sister Lieseleta looked with her usual exasperated look at her before repeating herself.</p><p>“I said that the chances of interacting with Lady Rozemyne are very slim for you now, sister.”</p><p>“What?! Why?”</p><p>All her sister did was sigh. This was not the time for that, she had to know why she could not approach Lady Rozemyne. She was the perfect sparring partner!</p><p>“You were there, why do you need me to inform you of this? You are lucky the news spread like wildfire already!”</p><p>“Sorry, Lieseleta.”</p><p>Maybe she should have paid more attention, but the sight was so captivating. She paid close attention as her sister continued.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne’s action caught the attention of Lord Bonifatius, who was present at the exercise. He proclaimed her as his disciple, and she agreed to the offer. They will most likely train separately from the other apprentices.”</p><p>‘What?! That is so unfair! I wanted to train with her myself, and she even catched Lord Bonifatius' attention? I am so jealous!’</p><p>“So forget about training with her, sister.”</p><p>“But I wanted to spar with her too…”</p><p>Those news were devastating, she would never get a chance now.</p><p>“Maybe if I serve her, we can spar then?”</p><p>“She is an archnoble, sister. She cannot have a knight serve her.”</p><p>She sank to her knees in despair, her dreams in tatters.</p><p>She found some solace in the next training exercise, even if she could not avert her eyes from Lady Rozemyne easily. Lord Bonifatius seemingly was advising her in hand to hand combat at the moment. She felt another spike of jealousy and longing, she shook her head to get rid of these thoughts. She simply had to train harder, maybe she could join them if she improved enough!</p><p>At the end of the exercise she was taken to the side by Lord Guthfried to talk about some things. She did her best to pay close attention.</p><p>“Angelica, is there something on your mind? You were unusually unmotivated for today's training.”</p><p>So even Lord Guthfried noticed it? Was she that transparent? She decided to answer his question honestly, he had always guided her well in the past.</p><p>“I am just sad I did not get a chance to spar with your daughter, Lord Guthfried. After her amazing display I was looking forward to it so much, but Lord Bonifatius took her as his disciple. I cannot even approach her because of that and serving her is out of the question too. I was told knights can not enter the service of an archnoble.”</p><p>“Ha, it's true, my adorable daughter is simply amazing isn't she? But tell me, Angelica. Why would you even want to serve her, if all you want is a simple spar that can be arranged. How about you join the next time I will train her at our home?”</p><p>She instantly perked up at the offer, was Lord Guthfried truly offering her this chance? Just like that?!</p><p>“Really?! I would be honored, Lord Guthfried!”</p><p>He simply chuckled while nodding his head.</p><p>“Sure, wait here for a moment, I will ask her if she agrees.”</p><p>He made his way towards the site where Lord Bonifatius and Lady Rozemyne were currently talking, after having destroyed the part of the yard assigned to them. After a short talk with his daughter he returned to her with a slight smile.</p><p>“She has agreed to my proposal, so how about you join us in four days at third bell at our mansion?”</p><p>“Yes!? Thank you so much, Lord Guthfried!”</p><p>Her dreams were not destroyed after all! She could not wait for her chance to spar with Lady Rozemyne!</p><p>The four days flew by her in a blink of an eye, not even her parents' apprehension could dampen her mood. She took out her highbeast and flew towards the Thorwaechters’ mansion, arriving just before third bell.</p><p>She was greeted by a servant, who introduced herself as Jenni and was then guided towards a section of the gardens. Apparently it was used by the family as a sort of personal training yard. She was hard pressed to keep her hype in check.</p><p>Just as they arrived she saw that Lady Rozemyne was currently sparring with her father in a fierce battle, both of them using wooden poles to simulate spear combat. Her blood pressure rose just from watching them, she wanted to join them so badly, she was practically shaking. For now she had to wait at the sidelines to be acknowledged by them. She saw that Tuuliane was standing at the sidelines too so she joined her to watch the match together. The fight ended as Lord Guthfried used a faint and hit his distracted daughter in her left leg, after a short talk they turned towards her. That was her cue, she walked towards them before giving her greetings.</p><p>Surprisingly it was Lady Rozemyne who spoke first after she stood up.</p><p>“My, so we meet again, Angelica. My father informed me of your desire to honor Angriff together with me. I personally do not see a problem with it. I am just curious what brought this on.”</p><p>“Indeed, Lady Rozemyne. After your performance in your first Knight Order exercise I just wanted to spar with you. I just had no opportunities after Lord Bonifatius declared you as his disciple.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne laid her right hand onto her cheek and gave her a slightly distressed look, did she perfect this look just like her?!</p><p>“Your desires are not much more hidden than what Ewigeliebe wants, are they?”</p><p>She looked to the ground, slightly ashamed.</p><p>“...Yes, my parents tell me that constantly, I am sorry my Lady.”</p><p>“Do not fret. It is kind of endearing, really.”</p><p>She looked up, slightly shocked. That was the first time she was not scolded or ridiculed for her lacking behavior, was Lady Rozemyne a saint?</p><p>“I think that is enough of Grammaratur’s dance for now, let Angriff guide our hands instead, Angelica!”</p><p>“Yes! Gladly!”</p><p>Lord Guthfried moved to the side as she took a position opposite of her opponent.</p><p>“Which weapon do you prefer, Angelica? I am currently proficient in the spear, halberd and sword but I am learning hand to hand combat from my Mentor.”</p><p>She was already learning multiple weapons? If she was as good as she saw in her training with Lord Bonifatius that was even more inspiring. She came all this way for this, she would not back down from such a promising fight!</p><p>“I prefer the sword, my Lady.”</p><p>“The sword it is then.”</p><p>Both of them were handed wooden short swords by Tuuliane, she tested the balance and weight, it was very well made for a simple training tool. She gripped the wooden sword and took her stance before focusing on her opponent. What she saw took her slightly back.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne held her weapon in her right hand, it was held at an angle at her side, most likely to prepare an upwards cut to the left. She had expected a double-handed approach from her. Unusual but nothing she could not deal with, she took a look at her opponent's face next and could not suppress the slight shudder going down her back.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s usual noble smile was replaced by a small grin, appearing nearly feral, but it was her eyes that caught her attention. The gold of her irises deepened into a look that seemed to analyze her every movement, there was no warmth to find in them at all now. It made her feel small, insignificant. The feeling of danger she felt from her at the first practice returned tenfold.</p><p>As Lord Guthfried raised his hand to start the match she decided to go all out, and saturated her body with the familiar flow of her mana. The slightly warm feeling announced her successful activation of enhancement magic. She was prepared.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>At the signal she dashed towards the left of Lady Rozemyne’s position with every ounce of speed she could muster. Those scary eyes were following her movements flawlessly but just as she was about to strike her target from the side at hip level she simply disappeared in a rotating movement.</p><p>The performed flourish completely sidestepped her attack and she felt the force of a hammer, smashing into her chest. Her vision swam slightly as tears emerged and any air she held was forcefully ejected from her lungs. She faintly registered she was tumbling a few meters away from her last position before she used her left hand to right her stance, kneeling on the ground. She coughed a few times, the returned airflow feeling liberating.</p><p>She was about to get up again as Lord Guthfried called the match.</p><p>“Angelica, is defeated. Rozemyne wins!</p><p>‘What?! But I can still fight!’</p><p>She was about to voice her protest until Lord Guthfried looked at her sternly, pointing at his neck. She stilled, dropped the sword in her right hand and raised the trembling hand towards her neck. She felt a slightly wet sensation and removed it from her neck to inspect her hand – there was a little bit of blood on it! She stared at her hand in disbelief.</p><p>She registered that Tuuliane was approaching her with a simple  handheld mirror in her hands, which she offered towards her. She took the offered item with her shaking left hand, before using it to inspect her neck more thoroughly. There was a small cut along her throat! She slightly shivered, that was why the match ended. If it would have been a real fight she would have most likely climbed the towering staircase by now. She looked at Lady Rozemyne in awe. She was this strong already?!</p><p>“My dear daughter, I already told you to stop aiming at the throat, at least in training. It is unsettling for your opponents!”</p><p>“My, how weak of them.”</p><p>Lord Guthfried was shaking his head in exasperation, while Lady Rozemyne looked at her before speaking.</p><p>“Did I unsettle you, Angelica?”</p><p>“Well a little but still, this is amazing. You are so talented, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne smiled at her warmly.</p><p>“Do you want another try then?”</p><p>“Yes, please!”</p><p>“Oh dear, you are truly bereft of Grammaratur, are you not? Very well, let us dance again. But first, may Heilschmerz’s Blessing be granted.”</p><p>She was even healing her! Lady Rozemyne was truly such a generous lady. Why could she not be an Archduke candidate, she could serve her then! She buried those thoughts for later as the both of them retook their positions. She would try to land a hit on her multiple times only to be defeated in mere moments, without fail. She felt herself growing stronger with every try, it was the best feeling ever! Sadly their session ended at fifth bell and she was escorted towards the entrance by Lord Guthfried personally.</p><p>“I can't thank you enough for your invitation today, Lord Guthfried. I learned a lot!”</p><p>He chuckled at her outburst.</p><p>“Do not worry about it, but still be aware this will likely be a one time thing, my daughter will be quite busy from now on, as she is preparing for her debut. Afterwards she will likely focus more on her training or join a retinue, so she will have even less time.”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>So this was truly the last time she would have a chance to train with someone this powerful? It made her sad all over again.</p><p>“Why can’t archnobles have knights to serve them? If I could join her, we could maybe spar sometimes…”</p><p>“Why not become her attendant then?”</p><p>She paled at the mere thought of becoming an attendant. It was simply impossible for someone like her.</p><p>“I- I cannot do that. I would never survive being an attendant, I would not even wish for someone to endure my failings either.”</p><p>Maybe she was too honest again, but laying her heart open to Lord Guthfried had brought her to this amazing day. She did not regret it in the least.</p><p>“Well, if you are truly determined to become her knight there is a way but…”</p><p>“There is?!”</p><p>She swirled her head towards him. Did she hear him right?</p><p>“Well, yes there is a way but it is not to be taken lightly. It would come at a great personal sacrifice. It would be giving your very life to her, everything you are would be at her direct control, to be discarded with a simple thought. Are you truly willing to go that far just to serve my daughter for a simple opportunity to spar?”</p><p>He regarded her with his full attention, as she thought about his words. Would she be willing to give her life for Lady Rozemyne? Yes, she would. It was the duty of a knight to give his or her life for their chosen master, to shield them from any harm that threatened them. She voiced her thoughts again.</p><p>“Is that not the duty of any knight? To protect their master from harm?”</p><p>“Hm, you do not seem to get the whole picture. Let me explain a little bit more clearly. You would bind your very life, your very being to her. It is an oath not lightly taken, for it cannot be revoked. Should your master ascend to the heights above, you will follow them, regardless of your condition. Your life becomes their property, to be used as they wish. You can be ordered to fulfill any order given to you, and you can not refuse it, or you will climb the towering staircase. Because of that you will never be able to become the heir of your house. Your loyalty would not be to them but towards your master, it is in the truest sense the ultimate show of loyalty towards an individual. Do you understand what I am saying, Angelica? Are you truly willing to give everything you are to my daughter?”</p><p>She misunderstood slightly then, but was she willing for all of that? It was much more than was expected from a knight, did she want that? She had the most fun she ever had in her life when she sparred with Lady Rozemyne, she even got stronger because of it. But was it worth everything he mentioned?</p><p>She knew she did disappoint her parents often and Lieseleta was the heir for their house anyway, so what did she really lose? Argh she was not good at thinking! She knew that. Wait she had to ask another thing.</p><p>“Um, Lord Guthfried I- I am not really good at thinking things through, I know I am a failure as a Lady already. Is Lady Rozemyne blessed by Mestionora?”</p><p>“It is my honest opinion that my daughter is a genius. She has already learned the theoretical parts of the curriculum of the Royal Academy for the first to sixth years.”</p><p>Angelica’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Sh- She what?! She has already learned the material of the sixth year of the knight course?”</p><p>“Oh no you misunderstood me again, I meant she has already learned the theoretical material usually taught until the sixth yeah in all of the courses available to her, attendant, knight and scholar course. And yes I am serious.”</p><p>She needed a moment to process this. So not only was Lady Rozemyne a natural knight, better than her just after her baptism. She was also not put off by her natural failure in lady matters so far and she was having so much fun sparring with her and she even got stronger by it too. And she was a genius who most likely would have finished the theoretical parts before she even attended the Royal Academy, which meant…</p><p>She could help her to not fail in those too! Possibly. And having a master who is a genius would also mean she would not have to think and simply could let her master decide everything for her. What was there even to think about? She kneeled before Lord Guthfried, who eyed her critically still.</p><p>“I would be honored to swear myself to such an excellent mistress as Lady Rozemyne! Please tell me what I must do, Lord Guthfried!”</p><p>He scrutinized her for a few more moments before sighing and giving her a small smile.</p><p>“Very well if you are so determined, who am I to stop you? Tell me, Angelica. Have you ever heard of name swearing?”</p>

    <p>Why did he agree to his brothers endless arguing again? His big brother Lamprecht was insisting he should join the training exercise of the knight order today. To “socialize with other kids his age”, as if that would mean anything in their duchy. He already saw how the playroom worked, the supposed neutrality of the Knight Order was merely on the surface. Even now, just before the training was about to start, they stood in clear groupings of their factions, with the members of neutral families between the Florencia, Leisegang and Veronicans.</p><p>He was currently busy ignoring his brother, who was droning on about the burden he called master, Lord Wilfried. He was just glad that his brother was interrupted by the arrival of Lord Guthfried, who was accompanied by a girl he introduced as his daughter, Rozemyne. She had long, midnight-blue hair, which reached her lower back. Strangely it had a slight sheen to it, and flowed in the wind with even the slightest breeze. She had a really pretty face, with big golden colored eyes. Her slightly pale complexion was indicating she did not leave her home often, which was not that unusual before you got baptized.</p><p>After her introductions, the girl moved towards the Veronican side of their grouping, taking a prominent place among them. He expected as much, she was one the few archnobles currently present, even if she was the youngest of her rank. He did not really pay attention to what was said until he heard her questioning how her father was this strong. Before anybody could answer it was one mednoble knight girl with blue hair who spoke up first. If he remembered correctly her name was Angelica?</p><p>“They are using enhancement magic.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at her in confusion. He was slightly confused too. The mednoble girl normally never spoke up about anything, staying mostly silent during the training.</p><p>“Enhancement magic? How does that work exactly? Oh my, do forgive me, how rude of me. I am Rozemyne, what is your name if you do not mind me asking?”</p><p>“I am Angelica.”</p><p>So he was right about her name, good to know.</p><p>“Oh so you are Angelica. My, Tuuliane mentioned you as her friend from the playroom, what a coincidence indeed.”</p><p>Angelica looked at Rozemyne in apparent confusion.</p><p>“Tuuliane became my apprentice attendant after my baptism this summer.”</p><p>He was slightly startled as his gut feeling warned him of danger nearby, he let his vision wander around for a few moments, but could find nothing which would explain the sudden feeling.</p><p>“I do dearly hope we can become friends too, Angelica. But you mentioned enhancement magic, did you not? What is it and how does one use it?”</p><p>It was really apparent her father had maybe sheltered the girl a little bit too much. He was a very proficient user of it, after all.</p><p>“Um, you let your mana flow through your body until it feels slightly warm, then you focus on the part you want to empower and bam!”</p><p>…What? No, no, no. That was not how it worked at all! Did this mednoble girl not remember those lessons given to her? How could she give such an obviously false and childish statement towards another person who outranked her?! He was nearly about to intervene but before he could say anything she answered to those insane instructions herself.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>He was slightly confused now. What was there for her to understand?! The whole explanation was ridiculous! Rozemyne looked away from Angelica and raised her right hand to look at it more closely, she clenched and unclenched it a few times before turning her sight towards Angelica again.</p><p>“So, how do I test if it actually works, Angelica?”</p><p>Wait! Did she actually understand something from that insanity?!</p><p>“You hit something?”</p><p>What even was this conversation? Was she serious?</p><p>Angelica looked around them and pointed at the small wall that was used for their climbing exercise.</p><p>“Like that wall.”</p><p>…She was really serious about all of that, wasn’t she? Was this mednoble girl named Angelica insane? Did she not think of the potential consequences for herself, or her house, if an archnoble daughter gets injured because of her poor advice?</p><p>“...That wall is like an arm length thick.”</p><p>A quite snicker on his left side made him suddenly become aware he was not the only person following their conversation. Everyone of the apprentices had stopped their own conversations to follow their every word. He watched as Rozemyne walked towards the wall and stopped before it, assuming a striking pose. She was seriously going to hit it? She took aim and swung her fist towards the wall before he could even try to intervene.</p><p>CRACK!!!</p><p>His eyes widened in shocked surprise, as the strike allowed her to penetrate the wall as if it was the easiest thing in the world! Rozemyne grimaced slightly before removing her arm from it in apparent ease and flexed her hand – which was uninjured to boot – a few times before looking at the wall once again in apparent contemplation. She took a step back and he wondered what she would do next. She then gave the wall a spinning kick with her right leg. The results were more devastating than he could have ever imagined them to be.</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>The section that was hit exploded in excessive force, the tremor being felt even at his current position by a slight shake of the ground causing him to instinctually assume a safer stance to stand. Some of the other apprentice knights exclaimed startled shouts of fright or loud gasps. The rest of the wall crumbled into a huge pile of debris as a gigantic smoke cloud was spinning around the girl as if trying to embrace her. It was the most absurd sight he had ever witnessed, and he had seen his Grandfather in action a few times!</p><p>“L-Lady Rozemyne!?”</p><p>He could not suppress his surprised exclamation upon the sudden chain of events. The sudden explosion drew the attention of the entire knight order, who stormed towards its location. He had half expected for her to be scolded and maybe shift the blame towards that insane mednoble but after verifying what happened she was praised for it instead? By the gods her father had scooped her up and was currently spinning her around in apparent joy!</p><p>Things began to escalate as his grandfather himself joined the conversation, after she was placed on the ground again. How was she not dizzy after she was spun around that much?</p><p>“What a splendid use of enhancement magic! You trained your daughter well, Guthfried.”</p><p>“I did not train her at all before this, Lord Bonifatius. That was just her.”</p><p>He had guessed as much from the girls' questions, it did not seem to be an act on their part either. Her father’s surprised joy was apparent for everyone to see. His grandfather turned towards Rozemyne next as he voiced his question.</p><p>“You did not train her before? I see. Would you mind telling me how you knew how to do all of this, little one?”</p><p>“Of course, Lord Bonifatius. I got curious after seeing my father’s performance in the exercise and asked the other apprentices about it. One of them explained to me how to use enhancement magic, and pointed at this wall to demonstrate. I do confess I was maybe overly eager to test it out, my sincerest apologies. I have always keenly felt the fire kin’s calling within me, but I would not have expected such a strong blessing from Angriff.”</p><p>Her apology was brushed aside with a simple wave of his grandfather's hand.</p><p>“Nevermind the wall, that can be repaired. So that was your first time using enhancement magic?”</p><p>“Yes it was, Lord Bonifatius.”</p><p>“Hmm. Who did instruct you on how to use it?”</p><p>Rozemyne’s face was now looking slightly distressed, her right hand placed softly on her cheek.</p><p>“I do believe she was called Angelica, but please be not too harsh on her, Lord Bonifatius. It was me who acted upon her directions after all.”</p><p>His grandfather was obviously contemplating something, he did not like the sight at all. He did not like the look towards the ruble and in his direction either. He also did not miss that he ignored the insane mednoble girl's contribution.</p><p>“You were just baptized this summer, correct? I believe your name was Rozemyne?”</p><p>“To be remembered by someone of our exalted Archducal family is a great honor indeed. You are of course correct, Lord Bonifatius. I am Rozemyne Tochter Thorwaechter, proud daughter of my beloved father and mother, Lord Guthfried and Lady Roselinde, respectively.”</p><p>She accompanied her introduction with a short courtesy. Her fathers chest was nearly swelling with obvious pride. His grandfather gave a short chuckle.</p><p>“And you are well mannered too. Tell me little Rozemyne, how about becoming my disciple? Talent like yours should be nourished from the beginning.”</p><p>He slightly choked on his spit, his grandfather wanted her as his disciple?! He did not even offer such a position towards her father, Lord Guthfried or anyone from his direct family. And he was invested into Lord Guthfried since he joined the knight order, if his father’s story were to be believed. He could barely believe his ears. Of course he was not the only one shocked as nearly everyone began to whisper about it near immediately. He nearly missed her answer because of it.</p><p>“I am most grateful for your gracious offer to become my Erwachlehren in the matters of Angriff, Lord Bonifatius. I humbly accept your benevolence. Should I change my way to address you then too? Teacher or master perhaps?”</p><p>“For now, you may call me Master, little Rozemyne.”</p><p>“As you command, Master.”</p><p>“Good. Good. Follow me then. I shall test your prowess right now!”</p><p>And so they both departed towards the other side of the training yard, leaving the rest of them to deal with the potential cataclysmic fallout of those words, so easily voiced by them.</p><p>The exercise was canceled soon after, so he took the time to watch the new Master and disciple duo for a little bit more before he had to depart. Surprisingly enough Rozemyne was holding her own against his grandfather rather well, it seemed. Even if she was breathing heavily, in obvious exhaustion by now. He still could not bring himself to look away from it, even when his grandfather's calculating glances between her and him made him feel really anxious.</p><p>Watching them both destroy the training yard assigned to them with their raw might became his new fascination while he had to wait for the moment the apprentices could join the exercises. Most of the girls along their group were apparently beginning to see Rozemyne as some sort of goal to aspire too, regardless of factions. The most outspoken about this was Angelica of all people, who fanned Rozemyne’s reputation to even greater heights, as she regaled them with the tales of a sparring session in the Thorwaechter estate. She apparently was allowed to join one time after the first incident because of Lord Guthfried’s goodwill.</p><p>‘Maybe I should try training harder too? Everyone is just so full of energy right now. And watching those two destroying the grounds makes me feel inferior just by watching…’</p><p>With his new resolve he decided to invest more time into his training as a knight. Maybe he was being swept up in the mood of the other apprentices but he still had more fun than he would have expected to have.</p><p>Just a week later he had a kind of serious talk with his mother that put a slight dampener to his mood. It did not even surprise him that it was about Rozemyne again.</p><p>“Cornelius, I trust you are aware of the girl currently being trained by Lord Bonifatius, are you not?”</p><p>“Yes, her name is Rozemyne. But why are you asking me that now, you should have heard about all of this a week ago.”</p><p>The open smile on his mothers face made him tense up on instinct.</p><p>“My, oh my, you even remembered her name. How very unusual for my darling son. Do not think I did not notice how you even increased your training after she joined those exercises. Or that you suddenly began participating in those very same lessons you labeled as useless before. Is it maybe the first whispers of Bluanfah’s dance that I see?”</p><p>“Mother!”</p><p>He was mortified, disregarding her last inquiry. Was he truly this transparent towards his mother? She simply gave a refined giggle at his outburst. He just wanted to hide now.</p><p>“Do not fret my darling son, your grandfather may have made an actually sound decision for once at least.”</p><p>The sudden urge to flee increased even more as his mother’s smile turned into a smirk now!</p><p>“Do you want to know what he proposed, Cornelius?”</p><p>Did he? He was unsure, every instinct told him to ignore it and simply flee from this conversation. But his head told him to at least listen to it before making any decision. So he remained in his seat, before giving a hesitant nod.</p><p>"Excellent, now regarding Lord Bonifatius. He is completely taken in by this girl named Rozemyne, he has voiced his wish for her to join his direct family. So it is not unlikely she will become your or Traugott’s fiance in the future. How do you feel about that, my son?”</p><p>“F-fiance? I-”</p><p>Wait what?! His grandfather wanted to make them a couple? They were too young for that, they had not even developed mana sensing yet! Well she was really strong and pretty but…</p><p>And Traugott? That arrogant guy who thought he was better than anyone? Well he did see him looking towards Rozemyne a few times with a strange look but still…</p><p>“I see that you are not vehemently opposed towards it. You are both still young, simply keep it in the back of your mind for now, my darling son.”</p><p>How was he supposed to not think about exactly that, now that he was told something like choosing his potential fiance at ten?! He was supposed to be thinking about his first year at the Royal Academy, not this!</p><p>It took him until the next day to notice that his mother had not once voiced her displeasure about his grandfather’s plans.</p><p>‘Does that not mean she is supporting grandfather then?!’</p><p>All of those confusing thoughts accelerated Drehgarnuhr spinning as Ewigeliebe began to descend upon them and on the second Earthday of Winter it was time for him to join in on the usual Winter ceremonies. All of it flew by him without any note of interest before he saw that Rozemyne took to the stage, reserved for those presenting their harspiel performance of their debut. She wore a richly embroidered red dress, befitting the occasion which seemingly enhanced her obvious prettiness even more.</p><p>He shook his head to get rid of that stray thought. After seeing her destruction of the training yard multiple times and his potential bethroyal to her, he nearly forgot she was just seven years old. He risked a quick look towards her parents who were looking on anxiously but also seemed excited. Strange. What were they worried about? He looked towards the stage again.</p><p>After Rozemyne took her place with all the elegance expected of her station, the performance began, as she was instructed to perform the song dedicated to the gods. As she was born in summer she had to sing a song towards Leidenschaft. He heard the song a couple of times already, it was fairly upbeat, as far as he could tell. His expectations were completely blown away as she began to sing though.</p><p>He was aware she had a melodious voice before but it was as if he was bound by the sound of her voice alone. He got a strange, but pleasant feeling in his stomach as he continued to listen. His entire focus centered upon her image as she sung with her eyes closed. He felt his emotion going haywire and it took a lot of effort to rein his mana in again. Her singing was cut short much too soon in his humble opinion, as the song ended.</p><p>He opened his eyes shortly after its end. When had he even closed them to begin with? As he became aware of his surroundings once more, he noticed that some of the older Academy aged students had collapsed! While most of the ones not on the floor were looking at the stage with strangely transfixed stares, some were even openly crying!</p><p>The adults were similarly affected as most of them had their hands inside of their pouches, most likely containing feystones. The only ones, seemingly unaffected, were her family who were waving their Schtappes with great fervor.</p><p>What a mess.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>She did not expect much from the day her dad brought her along to one of those training exercises of the knight Order. Maybe some explanations for combat or some stretches or something, she was just seven after all. But upon seeing her father in action she could simply not let the chance to openly use enhancement magic slip through her fingers. Angelica's amusing byplay to her plot was just the funny icing on her cake.</p><p>Except she did go slightly overboard. Maybe. Using an advanced mana release impact was not really planned, she just did it instinctually at this point. Maybe that was karma because she got Angelica involved in her spontaneous scheme. Unsurprisingly it got Bonifatius’ attention, she did kind of  destroy a wall after all. And now she was in a reverse situation and had become his disciple instead of Angelica. But she could not really complain.</p><p>The whole incident also caught Angelica's attention. It was not her intended form of approach but why complain about it. Her dad apparently was some sort of mentor to her most airheaded knight of the past, as he organized a sparring session with them both after a few days.</p><p>The fight itself was fairly underwhelming but she still had some fun as Angelica simply did not get demotivated by their overwhelming gulf of combat skill and experience. She was aware she had a disposition to go towards the throat of her opponents. It was simply the most effective weak point to exploit in an opponent most of the time. So could she really be blamed for using that to her advantage? She shrugged off any criticism about it, and simply had fun sparring with her former knight. She was kind of sad as they had to stop too.</p><p>But she could be honest with herself, the fights she enjoyed the most were her spars against Lord Bonifatius, her current master.</p><p>‘I had not thought having to fight could be so much fun!’</p><p>Sparring with her grandfather of another life forced her to give it her all, within the current limitations that her young body could reasonably endure. She was tempted to try a song, but would that really be wise right now? Maybe she should let that one rest for now as another ace up her sleeve? Bonifatius smiled at her ferally before trying to provoke her into revealing more of her abilities. </p><p>“Come on little one! Is that truly the best you can do? show me more of your blessings! I am still only warming up.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>‘Fuck it, I know its petty and dumb but I don’t care right now.’</p><p>“Oh my, Master. There is something I wanted to try but are you prepared for it, I wonder?”</p><p>His smile only widened slightly in response.</p><p>“Try me.”</p><p>She took on a slight resting form and focused on her breathing to calm down a little. Now, which song to use was the question. She smiled slightly as a random thought entered her mind, the irony would be lost to everyone but it was funny in itself so why hold back? It was time to stretch her wings a little.</p><p>*****</p><p>She began to hum the haunting melody accompanying one of her first battle songs she ever created. She began to sing her deadly melody.</p><p>
  <em> ~Trapped in spirit to the earth~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~Where shadows find their due rebirth~ </em>
</p><p>She released the tight reigns on her mana, letting it flow freely through her body. The familiar warmth of mana changed upon her will, becoming slightly warmer, more focused. She raised the wooden training sword slightly above her head.</p><p>
  <em> ~My blade has fallen but rises new~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The final blow will still strike true~ </em>
</p><p>Using her unleashed prowess she charged towards the left flank of her opponent – no – her potential victim. She was not planning on holding back now.</p><p>
  <em> ~A gift, a curse, but not my own~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~A wish to guide this power home~ </em>
</p><p>She swung her raised blade down, the razor sharp winds unleashed from her weapon cut through the air towards their target. She faintly noticed that Bonifatius had lost his cocky grin and was regarding her with equal seriousness as he barely dodged her windblade by mere centimeters. Letting it carve a meter deep trench into the ground on impact.</p><p>
  <em> ~Through all the ghosts along the way~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~I'll live to fight another day~ </em>
</p><p>She used a simple spin of her body to evade his counterattack – a simple punch for her torso. She could not suppress the grin that most likely had taken root on her face. It felt so freeing to finally have an opponent who could challenge her again. Oh how she missed those spars with Hannelore…</p><p>
  <em> ~Breath of the unyielding wind~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The dragon within~ </em>
</p><p>She used the momentum of her evasion to turn the centrifugal force of her movement into fuel for her following kick at Bonifatius' side, sending the retired knight commander a few meters away. This allowed her to focus on the next move as she grinded her mana against itself creating a sweltering heat all around her.</p><p>
  <em> ~Keeps the flesh alive~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~To absolve my sin~ </em>
</p><p>She focused all of her attention towards her opponent who was coming at her again, fist already moving towards her torso again. He had to use another tactic to get her, she just hoped he would realize this soon. Enemies who did not learn from their mistakes were the most boring of opponents after all</p><p>
  <em> ~I'm the thief with a mark~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~Redeemed by the~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~Will of the undying spark~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The wolf in the dark~ </em>
</p><p>She was not disappointed as he changed his attack into a dive to the side in the last possible moment, as she moved her left hand, now forming a claw, forward in a simple forward thrust. The move shredded deep gorges into the ground once again. </p><p>
  <em> ~I am bound by monarch~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The thief with a mark~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The undying spark~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The wolf in the dark~ </em>
</p><p>She stabbed her sword into the ground and began to spin on her axis exactly nine times, with her right leg extended. It was faintly reminiscent of those Ice skating pirouettes she watched as a child in her life as Urano once. The winds she drew in with her spin supercooled the air around her, which was still sweltering with the heat of her expelling mana. The resulting shockwave of the desired phenomenon was sent by the accumulated force of her last spin outwards of her body.</p><p>
  <em> ~Land of conquest, age of war~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~The likes I've never seen before~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~With spirits rising, and dead unrest~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~This immortality's a test~ </em>
</p><p>She watched as her opponent crossed his arms and simply tried to tank her attack. Surprisingly, it worked fairly well, as he was merely shoved away for a few meters on the ground, but he still remained on his feet nonetheless.</p><p>
  <em> ~A gift, a curse, but not my own~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~A wish to guide this power home~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~Through all the ghosts along the way~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~I'll live to fight another day~ </em>
</p><p>She tried to take hold of her blade again, but had to realize it was most likely blown to bits by the forces she generated earlier. A pity. Bonifatius had seemingly recovered as he was regarding her warily now. It obviously was time for her to land a finishing blow with her next move. She could already feel that her body could not take much more in its current state.</p><p>
  <em> ~I rot the world around us~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~As the colors turn to gray~ </em>
</p><p>She accelerated the grinding of her mana to her current max, resulting in faint ambers of ignited mana hovering around her body.</p><p>
  <em> ~In a tale of death and pestilence~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~These footprints soon decay~ </em>
</p><p>She took steady steps towards her opponent, her feet leaving smoldering footprints in the ground behind her.</p><p>
  <em> ~So let us fade together~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~To a pure and mortal dream~ </em>
</p><p>She was faintly noticing his widening eyes, as she used all of the speed she was currently capable of, to charge towards him. Stopping just short of his body, as he tried to backpedal from her advance, a futile attempt at this point in time. Her grin widened as she delivered the crescendo of her battle song.</p><p>
  <em> ~I'll fight my way to get there~ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ~With this power in my bloodstream~ </em>
</p><p>A double handed palm trust was delivered right into his chest, causing him to choke. The force she unleashed burnt away any clothing covering the place of impact as he was thrown away from her with a loud sonic boom. The displaced air pulled her slightly forward, bringing her to her knees in the dirt. She used her arms to prevent her head from hitting the ground as she tried to get air back into her lungs with heavy breaths.</p><p>‘That should have taken something out of him at least.’</p><p>She let herself fall onto her side in total exhaustion. She should have guessed singing a full-on battle song would be above her current limit, especially after her previous training. Still worth it.</p><p>“Whatever you did was really impressive, Rozemyne. You make me proud to call you my disciple!”</p><p>She looked up, Bonifatius was sporting a huge grin as he looked down at her with parental affection?</p><p>“...I thank you, Master. But I cannot move anymore, my blessing from Angriff is spent I reckon.”</p><p>He laughed out loudly in return before patting his chest where she hit him with her finishing move. She only managed to cause him a serious looking burn wound it seemed, still a long road to go before she would regain her previous might indeed.</p><p>“Never mind that my precious disciple! All of those moves were fairly impressive. Why, your last attack depleted much of my mana just to defend against it. And it still hurt me in the end! I cannot simply let you lie in the dirt though. Do you mind if I take you to your home?" </p><p>It touched her that he cared enough to ask before hoisting her up, like she expected. So she simply smiled a true smile up towards him before giving her agreement. Being in his arms reminded her of being held by her dad, it was more gentle than expected. Was that truly the Bonifatius everyone warned her constantly about, whose hugs would kill her? She simply could not see it right now. She closed her eyes and allowed herself to succumb to her fatigue. She never noticed the sparkling eyes of a blue haired girl in the distance, holding her manablade in a deathgrip, while wiggling around in apparent delight for the opportunity to witness her fight.</p><hr /><p>Next she had to prepare for her debut this winter. She was aware she was a good singer – it was kind of her whole combat thing in the last weave with her battle songs – but she still thought her parents were overreacting as they both cried tears and waved their Schtappes around after she gave them a private demonstration of the song she was going to sing for her debut. Worst was her dad after he calmed down from it though.</p><p>“You cannot sing for anyone else except for us, my daughter! It will attract all forms of vermin you are not prepared to deal with!?”</p><p>She did not even know what he meant by that and honestly did not care for it in any way, she would sing however and whenever it pleased her. So she leveled a cold stare at him which caused him to slightly shiver.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Wha- What do you mean, no?! My darling daughter, I only want what is best for you! Please trust your father on this!”</p><p>She decided to ignore him until her mom set him straight. Something like his plea could not possibly be done and they simply had to take care of the consequences of her singing…</p><p>‘What are they even talking about?’</p><p>She got her possible answer after she finished her debut song and opened her eyes again. All in all she surmised it could have been worse. She had offloaded a lot of her mana by giving one massive blessing after another to her parents inside of her mothers hidden room on the morning of her debut. She also made sure to focus much of her attention to suppress any leaking mana, while she played the harspiel.</p><p>She did not expect for some of the audience to faint while she played though. It was almost as if she was Ferdinand during the concert, but even worse because apparently everyone was affected and not just the women. By the gods even some of the girls looked at her with those strange reverent looks now. Was her singing really that much of a deal? It never was in the first weave. What did she miss here? At least her parents appeared happy to hear her performance again, if the wildly waving of their schtappes were any indication.</p><p>She did not need that kind of attention, happenings like that were exactly what she was trying to avoid in the first place! It was even more chaotic than the concert as no one was in the least prepared for something like this. At least she was given no blame for what happened, she did not like the looks most of them were giving her now though. Not at all.</p><p>Then it was time for her to join the children’s playroom for the first time in her current life. She was a little bit excited, she did not have to lead anything this time. She was just your standard archnoble daughter and not the Archduke's daughter this time, so no responsibility for her. A small blessing.</p><p>She entered the room and instantly everyone’s eyes were drawn towards her as she entered. Huh? Ah, right she did cause all of that fainting earlier. She would simply lay low for a while until that had blown over, no worries. She ignored those curious eyes following her and looked around for her sister Tuuliane.</p><p>She found her standing beside Lieseleta and Angelica. Her sister blinked slightly, seemingly awaking from whatever daydream she was previously trapped in before speaking some words to her previous conversation partners. Afterwards she made her way towards her, and they exchanged their noble greetings before her sister took her subordinate position, slightly towards her right back.</p><p>Afterwards Rozemyne made her way along the other members of the Veronica faction, beginning with the other archnoble children. Those were surprisingly few, just a handful and none of them her age. So the conversations were just brief exchanges until she was free to do whatever she pleased, for now. All of her obligations being done with just a simple few greetings, truly refreshing!</p><p>She gave a few subtle glances towards the Leisegang and Florencia faction members. Most of them were eyeing her with critical eyes but she saw none who was openly hostile for now, which was better than she expected to be honest. She only saw that Leonore was looking at her with a poorly hidden peeved look. What?</p><p>She decided to ignore it for now and let her look wander around the room, searching for her old retainers she could approach without problems for now. Brunhilde, Cornelius, Leonore and Hartmut were out for obvious factional reasons.</p><p>Matthias and Laurenz were out too as they were boys and aspiring knights. Also they had not the faintest reason to possibly want to serve her currently. Nor could they, as she was neither an Archduke candidate or a Giebe, and could therefore not enlist knights into her service anyway. Which left Muriella and Gretia as the only approachable choices for her right now.</p><p>But realistically it was only Gretia. Muriella serving her was only so she could serve her old mother, Elvira instead. So she decided to ignore her for now and searched for Gretia instead. Her former attendant truly understood to sink into the background as it took her a second sweep of the room with her eyes until she finally spied the shy girl standing a bit away from another group of mednobles in the southeast corner of the room.</p><p>She noticed that Gretia was also watching her if her hastily moving head towards another direction was anything to go by. She suppressed a small grin as she moved towards her former attendant. She had to reign in her bemusement as she neared her target to see Gretia was obviously panicking at her sudden approach. She donned her best lady smile to engage her in conversation as she arrived before the now slightly shaking girl, really she was overreacting. She gave her a few moments after she arrived, to give her the opportunity to start their expected greetings. Seeing as Gretia was of lower rank, it would be expected of her to greet Rozemyne first.</p><p>“M-May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe?”</p><p>“You may”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>She took a moment more to watch this younger version of her former attendant a little bit more. As far as she could tell her presence and approach did greatly unnerve the girl before her. She gave the impression of wanting to run away, likely she was already being harassed by her family. Well time to start fixing that through her influence.</p><p>“I believe I caught your eyes earlier, as you may know my name is Rozemyne. May I inquire about yours as well?”</p><p>“M-My name is G-Gretia, Lady Rozemyne! Uhm, I-I beg your forgiveness for my poor behavior, p-please forgive me!”</p><p>Gretia bowed her head slightly towards her. Her body tense in fright? </p><p>“My, there is no need to apologize, Gretia. I was merely approaching to satisfy my curiosity. Do tell me what causes you to act like a Shumil before a Wolfenir though?”</p><p>“I am sorry! It just just-”</p><p>She merely continued to smile at Gretia. The lack of chastisement apparently caused the girl to relax somewhat in her presence at last.</p><p>“I was among those debuting along with you, Lady Rozemyne. Your song was simply captivating! I am sorry if my interest caused you discomfort.”</p><p>“Do not worry about that, Gretia. I am untroubled by your curiosity. My apologies if I may appear rude but you are of mednoble standing, correct?”</p><p>Gretia nodded slightly towards her.</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I see. I see. Do you have any plans for your future profession then? I myself intend to attend the knight course at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“Ah, I intend to become an attendant, my Lady.”</p><p>She could not suppress a slight chuckle at the expected response. She regarded Gretia with a slight grin as she gave her response.</p><p>“Oh my, my Lady you say? Quite ambitious for you to call me that already.”</p><p>Gretia got as white as a sheet before bowing her head again.</p><p>“Do forgive me, Lady Rozemyne! I never meant to imply-”</p><p>“Do you want to?”</p><p>Gretia looked up from her current bow, slightly confused at her interruption.</p><p>“I-I beg your pardon?”</p><p>"You are forgiven. I mean if you want to serve me as an attendant, Gretia?” </p><p>She gave her best to appear curious towards the still bowing girl before her.</p><p>“I-I mean c-can I? Um, I mean you do not know me at all, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Call it a stray blessing from Anhaltung and Sehweit, Gretia. If you want to become my attendant I will allow it. I did get a good feeling from you, not unlike Tuuliane here.”</p><p>She gestured towards her big sister, who gave a slight bow in return, but remained otherwise silent. Gretia took another moment before coming up from her bow and looked at her unsurely. Maybe she had to entice her slightly more, luckily she knew just how. She made her best Angelica pose.</p><p>“Seeing that you would not have any experience it would be expected of you to live in my family's estate for some time, to learn under my current head attendant, Mathilde. I do hope that is agreeable for you?”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>She did not expect a reaction this pronounced but merely smiled at the hopeful expression on Gretias face now.</p><p>“My, I would have thought that would be the biggest detractor. But yes you cannot learn to attend to me from afar, so you would be given a small room in my family's estate. If you, and your family agree, of course.”</p><p>“I will speak with them today, Lady Rozemyne. I thank you for this most gracious offer!”</p><p>She nodded at her and they gave their farewells. Now that she potentially recruited Gretia it was time to spend some time working on the others. The neutrals specifically. Which currently consisted of Angelica, her sister Lieseleta and Judithe. She guessed Judithe was out for the same reason as Angelica. She could not employ knights, or aspiring knights. So Lieseleta it was.</p><p>She was about to make her way towards the sister duo as the door to the playroom opened and an adult woman, she guessed some mednoble, looked around the room. She was obviously looking for someone. She got a bad feeling as the woman’s looks finally landed on her and made her way towards her current location. She gave the customary greetings as she handed a small parchment towards Tuuliane, who accepted it hesitantly.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, I was sent by Lady Veronica. She expects your presence in two days from now at her chambers. The letter bears her official invitation. I expect you are amenable towards the meeting?”</p><p>“Of course I am, please send my most humble regards to Lady Veronica. I simply cannot wait to meet her again, so soon after my baptism.”</p><p>She did not expect to be summoned by Veronica on her first day in the playroom. She had to confer with her parents immediately!</p>

    <p>Veronica took a seat inside of her hidden room, before dismissing her attendants, to contemplate in peace for a moment. She had so much to think about currently, all because of a little girl. The first time she heard of her was just an irrelevant side note that her little brother had taken a young girl under his protection inside the temple. Slightly unusual but she just dismissed it as another one of his fancies at the time.</p><p>Thinking about her little brother caused her to grimace, their relationship had slightly deteriorated after the whole Georgine debacle but she had thought he had fallen back in line. The information she received after his sudden demise on the other hand painted a very different picture. As far as she could tell he had tried to prop up this little girl into noble society.</p><p>His motivation was as clear to her as what Ewigeliebe wanted. He had always desired to become a noble himself, instead of her emissary within the temple. How laughable. Even if he truly did have it in him he should have been aware she would never allow that in the first place. He was much more useful to her in the temple, controlling the chalice distribution to further reign in those infernal Leisegangs. Those self righteous fossils had always been a thorn in her side, refusing to bow to the one rightful ruler in the sky. It was her, and her alone, she had made sure of that.</p><p>She was sure it was them who removed her little brother from this plane too. Them or that bastard in the temple, or maybe both of them together. She stuck her hand into her pouch containing her feystones to calm down. The investigation on the incident claiming her little brother’s life, ultimately led to nothing in the end. There was simply no possible way to pin it onto Leisegang or that bastard, which frustrated her to no end. She knew it was them, but for the first time in years they got the better of her machinations and removed one of her biggest pieces on the gewinnen board. She could admire the beauty of this scheme at the very least, regardless how frustrating it was for her.</p><p>In the end she got a slight consolidation out of it anyway. The whole incident had led towards this girl her brother wanted to support to rejoin her original family. That in itself was far below her notice, would it not be for the literal treasure she was presented with from the girl. Of course, she had nearly dismissed it when the girl's family had invited her to her upcoming baptism, it was only her innate curiosity which led her to order one of her servants to try out the concoction presented as a gift alongside it, rinsham they called it.</p><p>After seeing the results with her own eyes and her scholars assuring her of its safety, she tried it for herself and the results spoke for themselves. She glanced at the full body mirror inside of her luxurious room. Seeing her hair as lustrous as it currently was made her feel decades younger, for that reason alone she felt she could stop antagonizing the girl's family. She had originally punished them for their lackluster support after she allowed their marriage to begin with, and the fact Roselinde refused to give her name to her. She had been subtle about it, but the woman had outright refused her! Citing her want to give the very same to her beloved husband, as he was about to do the same thing. How old fashioned.</p><p>Still, she believed they had learned their lesson now. The mere fact they had presented this revolutionary new product to her first, instead of using it to plead favor from the factions opposing her, spoke volumes of their newfound humility. So she would allow them to further seek her grace without trouble from now. She had made sure to show them her regained favor at the girl’s baptism. Of course she had initially checked if she could get the complete rights towards this beautiful hair care product, but her scholars had discovered it was heavily guarded by a duchy wide contract.</p><p>It was a shame for the possible riches lost to her but she already had other plans for the obvious loss. Of course she could simply try to convince her son to dissolve the contract himself, but it was currently not worth the effort for a few paltry gold coins. The new weapon in politics inside of her palm, called rinsham, would do for now. The girl’s invention would be a most useful tool to affirm her control inside of this duchy. Speaking of the girl…</p><p>At first she was slightly shocked as she saw young Rozemyne for the first time. The little girl’s mere presence was so high above her supposed station it was nearly laughable, if she would have been told the girl was a royal princess, without her prior knowledge, she would have believed it! Was she truly a little temple flower? She was not so vain as to not recognize the obvious threat of the girl currently presented, even as a small child she was already turning heads. By the seven above, the mere fact alone that she was feeling even slightly inferior was proof enough. Little Rozemyne’s beauty and charm would only grow in the following years ahead, and she could not even remove her. Doing so would mean losing access to rinsham because of those contracts.</p><p>She decided to shelf those thoughts for later, Florencia and Elvira had just started to become more active again and she simply had not the time to deal with a subordinate right now. Especially not when they were currently behaving and falling in line again.</p><p>Or so she had thought until she was informed of Rozemyne again just shortly after. Apparently she had decided on the path to become a knight, which suited her just fine. But apparently the young girl was a never heard of prodigy with enhancement magic. Bonifatius had taken her as a disciple on the spot, and her sources were telling her the girl could keep up with him too! A little girl keeping up with that monster of a knight! She slightly shuddered then. Her threat level just elevated itself from potentially harmful to a serious issue, if not dealt with soon it could be a disaster.</p><p>She ordered the girl to be more closely observed. Elvira and Florencia were currently taking up much more of her attention, so no more thoughts were lost on the young girl until she was debuting this winter. Everything was fine until it was Rozemyne’s turn to present a song to the gods. But as she began to sing…</p><p>It was as if the gods themselves had blessed young Rozemyne’s voice, she was eerily reminded of that bastard inside of the temple. Looking around her after the performance was finished only further cemented her thoughts. Everyone was spellbound, some had even collapsed outright! To be fair it was only for the Royal Academy aged children, but Bluanfah was obviously dancing for at least some of them. It became more and more obvious she had to deal with the girl fast, before her influence grew to a level that could not be contained anymore.</p><p>But this whole performance presented an even greater immediate threat than her diminishing influence. Could her grandson Wilfried compare at all towards such obvious talent? Even if there would be a year in between their performances, there would obviously be comparisons towards Rozemyne for a few years at the least. She decided to check up on him just after she was free to leave the venue without appearing troubled, it would just simply appear rude as the head of the girl’s faction.</p><p>When she arrived at her grandson's chambers for a sudden test of his abilities, she was received warmly by her grandson in turn.</p><p>“Grandma! I missed you!”</p><p>She chuckled softly as young Wilfried ran up to her, his eyes sparkling in childish joy upon seeing her. His current retainers – all of them sworn to her by name, of course – bowed nearly as one upon her entrance to the chambers, as they should.</p><p>She gave her young grandson her best grandmotherly smile while she began to pet his head lovingly.</p><p>“I did miss you too, my dear Wilfried. Please tell me how you have been since our last meeting.”</p><p>The young lad had closed his eyes in apparent bliss from her open show of affection. There was a need to remedy this later. She could arrange for these meetings to be in a hidden room in the future to still bask in this warmth while he learned to hide his feelings better. But for now she was also reminded of the time her own son was looking at her with the very same look in his eyes. Which parent did not enjoy seeing their child looking at them like that? Truly the loving innocence of small children was a joy to witness.</p><p>Strangely it was even slightly more pronounced for her grandson, which may have been why she doted on him even more than Sylvester before his summer days. It was also one of her most pleasing thoughts, having her enemies robbed of the very same feelings as they mourned in despair. Making her vengeance against anything Leisegang even sweeter. Upon thinking about it, her noble facade broke slightly, but it only worked to her benefit as her true smile towards her grandson brightened his own in return.</p><p>“I had so much fun today, Grandmother! They tried to teach me reading again, and Lamprecht was not letting me leave the table. Those lessons were so boring though, I couldn’t stay still. I had to try a few times, but after some time I managed to escape Lamprecht and had some fun running around.”</p><p>He made a proud looking expression, laying his tiny first on his chest. She could not help herself but look at him even more fondly. The sight was so adorable.</p><p>“You can already outrun your knights, my little darling?”</p><p>“Of course. He did not stand a chance against me!”</p><p>“How impressive, still…”</p><p>She adopted her stern Grandmother impression next. Making Wilfried’s proud look falter.</p><p>“You know you cannot run from all of your lessons, and definitely not your knights, my dear Wilfried. What would I ever do if something happened to you? There are evil people outside just waiting for the smallest sign of weakness. Like those mean Leisegang I told you about!”</p><p>“But those lessons are so boring, Grandmother…”</p><p>His adorable face was tempting to give in to, but she had to be sterner from now on. Still she decided some positive reinforcement would not hurt, so she began to pet his head again.</p><p>“I know they are my sweet, but sadly they are necessary. Your father also ran from his lessons often, but even he did them eventually, as a good archduke should. In fact, he only tried to escape sometimes from them, like you do. But he did learn them all the same. You will become the Archduke in the future so you must show your superiority to those below you. And your skill and knowledge is one of many weapons you can wield against your enemies too. Just like a knight uses Angriff’s blessing to fell his foes before him. I wish you to be my little knight and defeat the challenges of these boring lessons for me. Will you do that for your Grandmother?”</p><p>“I know you are right, Grandmother. I will do my best in the future.”</p><p>She squeezed his shoulder slightly to show her approval.</p><p>“That is all I ask of you, my dear Wilfried. You make me proud to be able to call you my grandson.”</p><p>So easy to manipulate, and she could bask in his warm affection too. Truly, raising a child was a joy she dearly missed since Sylvester came of age. raising a boy was so much easier than a girl. She suppressed any thought about her other children like Georgine or the even more disappointing Constanze. Instead she spent some more time with her adorable Grandson, watching him play and demonstrating his strength to her, until it was time for him to be taken to bed. She began to sip the tea that was served to her as she waited for the rest of Wilfried’s staff who took him to bathe, massage, and dress him for bed, to return. Unsurprisingly it was Oswald who began to voice a hesitant question first.</p><p>“Lady Veronica, do forgive me but is there something you require in addition to meeting young lord Wilfried?”</p><p>She lowered her teacup as she pinned Oswald with a stern look, making him and everyone else in the room tense up.</p><p>“There is indeed. I have also come to check upon my dear grandson's progress in his education. You may not be aware but there was a recent…enlightening experience at the Winter debut this year. I wished to hear how his lessons were progressing from Wilfried himself, but he did not seem to recall finishing any lesson. So bring me the notes on his progress. Now.”</p><p>She did not like how some of them began to show signs of unrest upon hearing her orders. Upon seeing the notes offered to her she was positively shocked at the apparent lack of education. What she read nearly made her blood boil with anger, before being doused by Schneeahst.</p><p>“He can not write? Not even read!? What by the seven were you doing all this time?!”</p><p>She nearly threw her teacup in her anger but refrained at the last possible moment, the remaining liquid spilling on the floor beside her.</p><p>“Please, my Lady let me explain th-”</p><p>“What is there to explain? You obviously failed!?”</p><p>Her near shout caused most of them to cover before her wrath. She tried to regain her composure while pointing to the stains on the floor.</p><p>“What are you fools just standing around for? Clean this mess!”</p><p>“At once, Lady Veronica!”</p><p>She felt the beginning of a headache, her dear Wilfried was currently illiterate, which in itself was a massive flaw, but could be fixed until he joined the Royal Academy.</p><p>“Alright there is still time to correct your failure. What about his current skill in playing the harspiel? Did you at least teach him that?”</p><p>But apparently he could not even play the harspiel. At all.</p><p>“I have ordered all of you to make the boy receptive to me. To make sure that he would know my advice is always to be followed, and not make him so ambitious that he would want to think for himself. Wilfried was supposed to be malleable, not incompetent!?”</p><p>It was necessary so that she could direct his strings from the background, as she did with Sylvester until the stupid boy began his rebellious phase because of that damnable girl from Frenbeltag.</p><p>“When did I instruct you to ignore his education?! Answer me!”</p><p>“I- of course you never said anything like that, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>All of them began to kneel before her, but only Oswald was currently not trembling before her wrathful tearing into their hides. He was maybe more incompetent than she expected but at least he had the skill necessary to not simply tremble before her, unlike those other fools.</p><p>“Of course I didn’t you absolute fools, are you absolutely bereft of Mestionora or Sehweit? I need Wilfried at an acceptable level to not be contested for his position as the future Archduke. That of course requires for him to not appear completely incompetent to the other duchies or even worse, failing his debut. How did you expect him to perform during his debut in a mere year, if he cannot even play a single note? How did you expect him to complete the Royal Academy if he cannot read or write?! It will be your failing as his retainers if he brings shame upon himself or the duchy!”</p><p>What use had she of a puppet who could not fulfill its intended role? To think a child just picked from the temple could have a better instructor than the son of the Archduke! This needed remediation fast, they only had a few seasons for him to at the very least learn to play harspiel. To think she had been worried about a comparison between Wilfried and Rozemyne was absurd at this point. Even if he gave it his all he could never compare to an obvious talent like the girl who… Wait.</p><p>She stopped her reprimand of those incompetent servants of hers, much to their apparent relief.</p><p>“Correct this absolute farce of an education, I expect this to be fixed immediately! We have only until the boy’s debut, get to work!</p><p>“Yes, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>Afterwards she returned to her room and told her retainers she needed time to think inside of her hidden room. Which led to the current situation.</p><p>She had so many troubles emerging at nearly the same time, first that potential upstart Rozemyne. And now her failing puppet of a grandson Wilfried, so why not fix both of these problems by combining them? She could not help herself but get excited as she began to create another scheme. It was her only flaw she never managed to fix, at least she was aware of it and so she did most of it inside of her hidden room, in solitude where no one could see the shameless grin on her face.</p><p>Young Rozemnye was currently on the way to become one the best knights their duchy had seen in years, maybe even more. And was obviously talented in the arts, or at the very least a prodigy in playing harspiel and singing with an excellent instructor. Exactly what Wilfried currently lacked, so why not make the girl his retainer then? Obviously she could not make the girl his attendant, but his knight was possible. Of course there would be some rumors about why a young girl served a younger boy as a retainer to begin with. But these would work to hamper the girl’s growing influence too. And if she was already his knight, what was wrong about it if her instructor also teaches him about becoming better in the musical talents? Purchasing the instructor would be best, but she would even settle for shared lessons between the children.</p><p>By the seven, maybe her grandson would even become fond of the girl that way? She would make an excellent third or maybe even a second wife for him, as soon as she got the girl’s namestone in her hands. Of course she would not pressure the girl with all of that at once, she needed her at least slightly cooperative until Wilfried was fixed, at the very least. She spent a few more moments thinking about her newest plot, but in the end she was more than satisfied with her current plans. So she set them into motion, directing her attendants to invite young Rozemyne on the first day of her entering the playroom.</p><p>Applying high amounts of pressure, right from the beginning, worked best on some people. If it did not work on the girl she could always change her approach midway. Her attendants informed her that the girls voiced her immediate compliance with the sudden invitation. Good. At the very least she appeared to know her place already. Dregarnuhr spun her threads with exceptional speed until the time of their meeting as she was so very busy socializing with others.</p><p>She decided to have Oswald attend the meeting too, using his blood relations to the girl would at the very least give her another angle of coercion should the girl try to resist. And to be fair she most likely would too, if she were in the same position, she would overlook any possible resistance this time. The girl arrived just shortly before the agreed time, as was proper, before kneeling with her with her arms crossed and head lowered in deference. Her movements were as flawless and graceful as she expected.</p><p>“May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of Life?”</p><p>She took a bit more time than would normally be proper. This was a move she often used to affirm her position, above them. It worked wonders on those weak willed subordinates of hers. Apparently Rozemyne was not one of them, as the girl maintained her tranquil disposition without error as Drehgaruhr continued her weaving.</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>The girl then took the seat offered to her, their attendants beginning to serve them, she faintly noted that both of the girl's attendants were using rinsham for their hair, even the laynoble girl. So she was apparently favoring them. As would be expected, their initial talks were of no real import. She took a few more moments to scrutinize the young girl a little bit more. The way she carried herself would be something one would expect from someone of far higher rank than her. Maybe it was another one of her talents, or her instructor’s skill? She could not see even the slightest flaw to criticize so far. She gave the signal to change their tea, it was time for the real talk to begin. She would start with another attempt to pressure the girl slightly to see her reaction.</p><p>“I do hope you recognise your uncle Oswald. Though it may be unconventional, I am sure having your relative attending as a Guardian will sooth any possible anxiousness you may have. Having the guidance of someone so loyal must be reassuring.”</p><p>It was left unsaid that Oswald’s presence would be used against the girl, as he was loyal to her alone. But apparently this did not unsettle the girl at all, as she merely gave her a polite smile and nod towards them both before giving her answer.</p><p>“It does indeed warm my heart. To think you would place my comfort above Gebordnung is truly humbling, Lady Veronica. Why, it will be the first time my thread has crossed with my esteemed uncle. Lord Oswald was ever so distanced from our family since I rejoined them before my baptism. I would be foolish not to cherish this most unexpected reunion, for what it is.”</p><p>She could already see that this approach would not work at all, so she decided to change tactics.</p><p>“I am glad my intervention could help to prevent the workings of Jugereise, Geduldh is what one must cherish most after all.”</p><p>“Indeed, since your mother’s marriage, I have had so little opportunity to speak to her. Your grandmother laments her absence from family gatherings often. It was a great surprise to us all when Ordoschnelli sang the news of your baptism.”</p><p>She decided to let Oswald work on the girl for now.</p><p>“Oh my, is that so? I cannot say I have heard my mother mention any invitations she received to attend these gatherings since my birth, Lord Oswald. Although as you have probably heard, I did not have the privilege of Wiegenmilch’s embrace for some time.”</p><p>Maybe using Oswald as a means to silently pressure the girl was proving itself to be less effective than expected if they were estranged to this level.</p><p>“You must call me Uncle Oswald, dear niece, I insist.”</p><p>“Very well, Uncle Oswald.”</p><p>“The circumstances of your upbringing is a great tragedy for our family indeed, however fear not. Now that we have been reconnected through Lady Veronica’s grace, our family will be sure to look after you and ensure that you are not cast out again.”</p><p>She gave her best grandmotherly smile, before taking a sip of tea and steering the conversation back to the topic at hand.</p><p>“It concerns me deeply that the Goddess of Separation has taken such an interest in your family. It is my intention to be Flutrane, bringing Gebordnung in place of Jurgereise. I am sure you are aware of the tradition of your maternal family?”</p><p>"Indeed I am, Lady Veronica. Bearing the honor of serving the Archducal clan as an attendant, like Lord Oswald. My paternal family carries a similar tradition, serving as a knight instead to protect Geduldh. It is my honor to uphold this tradition, as my father's line is not as blessed with exceptional individuals as my mother's.”</p><p>How clever, trying to deflect her argument with the traditions of her paternal family. It also showed the girl had already grasped her intentions, or maybe her parents had warned her of them in advance.</p><p>“How kind of you to praise me, Rozemyne. Rest assured, there is place for more talent such as you in our family.”</p><p>She deepend her grandmotherly smile to reinforce Oswald's point even further.</p><p>“Indeed, very thoughtful of you. Do not fret, little Rozemyne. There is a way to honor both of your ancestral roots at the same time. Choosing to become a knight is most fortunate, as it will allow for just this opportunity.”</p><p>The girl seemed unshaken and simply took an elegant sip of her tea.</p><p>“Oh? To think you would act as my Anhaltung yourself, Lady Veronica. I am most honored indeed.”</p><p>“Oh ho ho. Never mind such trivialities, my dear Rozemyne. It is the duty of those who rule the heavens to guide the young stars under the dark cloak. But back to my point, what do you think about serving the archducal clan directly, as an apprentice knight?”</p><p>The girl made a distressed face as she laid her right hand on her face, while tilting her face slightly to the side.</p><p>“But seeing as I am a girl would that not mean to serve Lady Florencia or her daughter? Serving them would mean leaving our current embrace of Schutzaria. Do you intend for me to become more acquainted with Verbergen to become Ordoschnelli, Lady Veronica?”</p><p>‘Hmm, not a bad attempt to distract my attention into making her a spy towards Leisegang or Florencia. But I will need her much more urgently to fix my Wilfried.’</p><p>“Do not worry yourself, Rozemyne. I would not burden you to become my Ordoschnelli, pillars need to be in their correct position to support the heavens after all. Rather I think you would be perfect to serve as Leidenschaft to the one who will don the dark cloak of our Geduldh in the future, my grandson Wilfried himself.”</p><p>After her pitch she watched the girl take another calm sip of her tea. It was in stark contrast to what she would have expected.</p><p>“But would it not be disadvantageous for Lord Wilfried to have a young girl serving him directly? I could never burden those residing in the heavens with having to worry about their heir’s reputation, just to further my standing.”</p><p>“Please do not worry about the opinions about young Wilfried, Rozemyne. Seeing as Oswald is his current head attendant, it is only seen as normal that he would introduce his close relatives as his possible retainers. It may be a bit too soon, seeing as he has not entered the playroom yet, but any future Aub is always in need of capable retainers to serve him.”</p><p>She gave a nod towards Oswald, to amplify the pressure.</p><p>“It would be most fortunate if you would join me in service to our future Aub, my dear niece. It is as Lady Veronica stated, your talents would be wasted bearing the burden of becoming a mere Ordoschnelli.”</p><p>“My, Uncle Oswald, I am not sure I have such talent you speak of.”</p><p>“Of course, a young girl like yourself is not yet aware of your capabilities. Rest assured, if Lady Veronica sees you as promising, she will most certainly offer you the position most suited for you, for she is highly blessed by Seheweit and Anhaltung.”</p><p>“I am humbled to even be noticed by someone so high above myself just after my baptism.”</p><p>“As you should be, niece, it is a great honor for the family. Should you do your job well, you will surely see the benefit yourself as well. Do not mistake Greifechan's blessing as Glucklitat's trial.”</p><p>The girl set her teacup down, before crossing her arms and bowing her head slightly.</p><p>“I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Uncle Oswald, Lady Veronica. For bringing Anhaltung’s grace and bearing the burden of playing the role of Erwachlehren on those matters. I simply feared any off-tune melodies endangering our duchy’s heir before his blessing by the Seven. Am I to become Leidenschaft, for Lord Wilfried, instead of Lord Lamprecht?”</p><p>She gave a dramatic sigh, feigning slight distress herself, before giving her answer.</p><p>“That is indeed what we would ask of you, Rozemyne. Of course, that is not a position your Uncle’s connection would allow you. However, I am granting you the honor of becoming Wilfried’s Leidenschaft, should you accept the offer. Sadly there is also another matter, however. You see, it came to light that the current Erwachlehren of my dear Wilfried was failing to uphold his vows in the matters of Kunstzeal. He was hence removed from his position. Alas I must request to purchase the instructor who nurtured your talent into the impressive performance at your debut. It saddens me to admit that finding a worthy Erwachlehren has been no small trial of Glucklitat. I could not bear to see my dear grandson stumble in his obligations, and a capable instructor who can polish Kunstzeal’s blessings in young talents is exactly what he needs.”</p><p>Just after she finished her offer, she was greeted with a troubled expression on the young girl’s face.</p><p>“Oh my, you honor me too much, Lady Veronica. I do ever so hate to disappoint, but I am afraid it is not within my power to comply with your request. If I had such a talented instructor, I would offer their services to you at once, sadly, I do not.”</p><p>She honestly did not expect such an answer, it could not possibly mean what the girl was implying, surely.</p><p>“Oh? Do elaborate, then, how did you come to play the harspiel so well?”</p><p>The girl added to her distressed image by lowering her head slightly, her voice grew quiet and distant as she dropped her gaze on her hands in her lap.</p><p>“But of course. As you know, I was raised in the temple until very recently. I did receive some instruction from gray shrine maidens in my youth, they taught me how to play each note, and how to read sheet music, but as lowly grays, none of them had great talent for music. I simply practiced a lot to allow Dregarnuhr to spin faster, and acquired new sheet music from the late High Bishop, which I taught myself. I am afraid the only capable instructor I can claim to have is Dregarnuhr herself, as any of my skills I simply gained over time.”</p><p>As she listened, she grew more and more impressed by the minute. If it was truly her natural talent, it was good she was beginning to bring her into her palms this early. This level of facial expression control was slightly terrifying in a child of her age but that could still be chalked up to her natural talents.</p><p>All of this skill just by practicing with those inferior grays in the temple?! What could the girl accomplish with actually skilled instructions? The thought was as alluring as it was troubling. Still she did not have the luxury to ponder the matter further right now.</p><p>“How commendable, my dear, to honor Kunstzeal, even in such a filthy place. In that case, I must request that you use your remarkable skill in this domain to assist Wilfried.”</p><p>“So you wish for me to become Erwachlehren for Lord Wilfried in addition to becoming Leidenschaft? I am ashamed to confess, but the burden may prove too much for me to bear. Not to mention the shame, should it be revealed Lord Wilfried needs lessons from his knights.”</p><p>It seemed they had arrived in the negotiation phase of their talks at least, she would normally simply order the girl to do it but this had backfired on her with Wilfried’s entourage already.</p><p>“You are right to worry about any influences of Chaocipher, young Rozemyne. But let me become Anhaltung once again, it would be a waste for a young lady of your remarkable talents to be barred from the chance to join those in the heavens.”</p><p>She noticed the girl's eyes had widened slightly. All in all it was still an impressive show of control of her impression, considering her age.</p><p>“My, I could even see yourself becoming Efflorelume or even Flutrane for our future Archduke, if you prove your blessings to those ruling in the heavens. Rest assured there is always the guarantee for me to find a suitable match for you in Ahrensbach, a greater duchy and our acting asylum. I am sure my dear daughter Georgine, who is married to their Aub, would support me, seeing that I am her beloved Wiegemilch.”</p><p>“How splendid! I hope you realize the weight of this offer, Rozemyne. Such wonderful future prospects are indeed very hard to come by even for a talented girl of your station. You will no doubt not receive a greater blessing from Greifechan if you miss this chance.”</p><p>The young girl was apparently still not convinced enough yet, as she tried to deflect from giving any form of agreement.</p><p>“It is indeed a great honor, and beyond the grace I could even imagine to be shown at such a young age. I am simply hesitant, as a freshly baptized noble, I believe I cannot accept an offer no matter how generous without permission from my guardians.”</p><p>At the very least she was running out of arguments if she already arrived at the point of having to involve her parents. It was nearly time for her to interfere again.</p><p>“Indeed, it is good you are aware of your limitations. However, as your uncle, I can most assuredly say that Roselinde would of course permit you to accept Lady Veronica’s generous offer.”</p><p>It was apparent Oswald had just walked into some sort of trap, as young Rozemynes seemed unimpressed by his words.</p><p>“Ah, Uncle Oswald, how I wish to simply use your word alone as reassurance. Oh but I am equally afraid of upsetting my mother. You see, she may not look kindly upon my accepting her younger brother’s word as her own, and I really would like to avoid getting into trouble.”</p><p>“That is… Ehm, as you say, my dear older sister was always the spirited young lady. While she may not always be happy for the men in the family to speak for her, I am sure she is smart enough to understand that it is for the best in this case.”</p><p>She decided to finally take hold of the conversation once again. While seeing Oswald being outmaneuvered by his own niece was amusing to watch, she was not willing to let that fool be the cause of her needing to order the girl to those duties.</p><p>“Rozemyne, dear, there is no need to be concerned over such trivialities. This little tea party of ours is simply for me to tell you of my wishes and understand yours as well. Any official arrangements would of course go through your parents.”</p><p>The arrangements may be made in the form of orders, but there was no need to spell it out loud. She watched as the girl picked up her teacup again to take another sip. She took a moment more before giving a question in return, appearing hesitant.</p><p>“Seeing as I have barely entered my summer, I would wish for Dregarnuhr’s grace to acquire more blessings from Leidenschaft’s kin. I do greatly enjoy my lessons with Lord Bonifatius, would it be too much to ask for some additional days off duty? I am unsure if my master would simply accept the sudden drop in the number of training sessions with him.”</p><p>She gave a slight nod towards the girl, she did not want to deal with that big oaf at all if she could help it.</p><p>“I do not see any problem with that, but I must insist that you wait until your new lord has finished his debut with aplomb. Seeing that Drehgarnuhr’s spinning is unending, I would recommend that you focus on being Erwachlehren in the matters of Kunstzeal instead of Leidenschaft for now, dear Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Veronica. All will happen as those in the heavens decree.”</p><p>What an endearing phrase, the girl was even more competent than she expected. She knew her place but did not buckle under pressure easily and knew when to fish for concessions without going above her station.</p><p>“Good. I know all of this is sudden but be prepared to be summoned very soon again.”</p><p>“Understood, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>“I am overjoyed you accepted Lady Veronica’s offer, Rozemyne. I look forward to the opportunity to spend more time with you and for us to get to know each other as family.”</p><p>Rozemyne gave Oswald a most beautiful lady’s smile. It was crafted to perfection. She was again impressed by the girl's apparently natural skill in facial control and manipulation.</p><p>“The feeling is mutual, Uncle. I cannot wait to tell my mother about Dregarnuhr spinning my thread closer together with her little brother. I am sure it will bring her great pleasure to hear of you again.”</p><p>Now that she was beginning to firmly grasp the girl into her control she could back off on this topic and focus her attention more back towards other pressing matters. She also had no need to listen to Oswald talk of family with the girl anymore either, so she dismissed her.</p><p>“It seems Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace.”</p><p>After young Rozemyne and her attendants left the room she turned her attention towards Oswald again.</p><p>“Make sure that your niece has no problem adjusting to Wilfrieds entourage. If there are some exceptions necessary because of her age or gender I do not care for it. Simply get it done. You heard of the girl's talents, should she not be able to fix my grandson on time I will hold all of you responsible, understood?”</p><p>He bowed low before her, as he should for this massive failure.</p><p>“As you wish, Lady Veronica. It will be done as you command.”</p><p>Afterwards she dismissed the man as well. She just hoped that would be enough to fix her grandson until his debut. It would be a shame if all the resources invested into him would have been for nothing. She had much to organize now. She made her way towards her unruly son's office next. Drehgarnuhr was favoring her as he was apparently just about to take a break, and had dismissed his retainers, except Karstedt of course.</p><p>“Sylvester, I come bearing ill tunes from Ordoschnelli. Please ensure Vebergen is honored.”</p><p>She sent a meaningful look towards his knight.</p><p>“It would be best if your knight remains too.”</p><p>Of course her son agreed immediately, at least some of his careful upbringing still remained. She waited until the blue colored barrier ensuring their privacy was fully erected before she spoke again.</p><p>“This matter is of the utmost importance so I will refrain from Grammaratur, my beloved son. I was just recently informed about a potential problem with dear Wilfried’s ongoing education. I will freely admit that I underestimated the sheer scope of it until I assessed it myself just after the recent debut festivities.”</p><p>She gave him a moment to let it sink in that she had just admitted to a mistake on her part. The admission caused both of the men before her to widen their eyes slightly. She suppressed the grin threatening to grow on her lips.</p><p>“It does appear that the teacher who was assigned to teach dear Wilfried about the domain of Kunstzeal was not able to fulfill his obligations. At all.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Her son's breathless exclamation was only to be expected.</p><p>“Of course, that fool was dismissed from service immediately, but apparently it was not only because of him alone this situation escalated to this scope. Tell me, Sylvester. Were you aware that young Wilfired’s personal knight was allowed to fail in his duties too?”</p><p>She leveled a disdaining look towards Karstedt, who to his credit appeared to not react at all.</p><p>“Being a young boy it was only a matter of course for my dear grandson to find his lessons boring sometimes. Just like you he tried to escape regularly. While those fond memories evoked Verbergen’s shroud over my eyes, it is no excuse for the obvious failings of his knight to allow his charge to flee from his lessons to the point that it impacted his education. The other members of his entourage were most exasperated in their recounting of Lamprecht’s lacking performance, to serve his lord adequately.”</p><p>“It got to this level? Surely they are exaggerating in those accusations, mother…”</p><p>She decided to level a stern look towards her son in return.</p><p>“Why do you not ask your knight, or Lamprecht himself, If Wilfried's current retainers are exaggerating on their lord’s attempts to escape his lessons. Surely he would be able to provide answers for his colleague's protests, wouldn’t he?”</p><p>She changed her look towards her son’s own personal knight again. Sylvester followed her lead and looked at him too and began his questioning.</p><p>“Karstedt?”</p><p>“... I did hear that my son was struggling to contain lord Wilfried at times, but I was not aware it was on this level. If you want more confirmation on this matter you would need to ask Lamprecht himself, Sylvester.</p><p>“So it's true?!”</p><p>“I did not say that, ask my son!”</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>She cleared her throat loudly to make them stop in this senseless byplay, as amusing as it was to see her newest scheme taking root firmly, there were still topics in need of discussion.</p><p>“Regardless of the scope, Lamprecht failed in his duties. We now need to move to remedy Wilfried’s education as fast as possible. It would not do for a future Aub to fail his debut, whatever the excuse may be.”</p><p>Sylvester slumped in his seat, seemingly lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>“I have already taken steps to recruit a new member for his entourage to fix those complications, I would only need your approval, my dear son.”</p><p>“Are you sure the person is adequate for the job, Mother? We can not allow them to fail. Who did you choose?”</p><p>She noticed he was becoming cautious, he truly did need to trust her more again, and finally drop out of this silly rebellious phase of his. She prepared herself for the coming protests.</p><p>“I know it may sound unusual, but I have already secured their agreement. The person I am thinking of is none other than young Rozemyne.”</p><p>“What?! But she is just a young girl, what about my son’s reputation? Or her own for that matter? Can a girl just entering her summer even teach him?”</p><p>“Do you have anyone better in mind, Sylvester?”</p><p>That made him shut up, now she needed to press her advantage even more.</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“Young Rozemyne is an extraordinary talent in playing the harspiel and singing too, you saw her yourself.”</p><p>“Well, yes but-"</p><p>“The girl is just a year older than Wilfried himself, I am sure he would be more motivated if someone his own age would approach him in the arts. I am sure he would only need to listen to her once, to develop enough motivation to at the very least try not to run from his lessons again.”</p><p>Her son was not giving any desperate argument anymore, seemingly choosing to listen to her argumentation.</p><p>“I am sure you also heard about her abundant blessings in the domain of Angriff too. Why, even Bonifatius was so impressed I heard he made her his disciple on the spot. Additionally the girl’s lineage makes her a member of a branch family of the Archducal clan itself. This should allow her to reprimand Wilfried without fearing the consequences, like Oswald, who is her uncle by blood. This fact alone should work to our advantage to at least quell any rumors regarding them, as long as the case is handled delicately.”</p><p>“What does the girl’s blessing from Angriff have to do with this? Do you want her to manhandle my son into his lessons? Also, the fact remains I cannot allow my son to have a female attendant.”</p><p>She let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>“Of course not, Sylvester. The girl is an aspiring knight, not an attendant. Of course she would serve Wilfried in this more appropriate role, becoming his knight.”</p><p>“A girl knight, huh…”</p><p>She gave him a few moments to think more about it, he was seemingly starting to agree. She just had to make her final pitch now.</p><p>“Not just his knight, I want to make young Rozemyne his head knight, effective immediately.”</p><p>“You want her to replace Lamprecht?”</p><p>She nodded towards her son, before replying to his question.</p><p>“The girl will soon be above Lamprecht’s level of fortitude, if she is not already. The rumors of her fights with Bonifatius are certainly trending towards that. It would also work splendidly to bring some form of punishment for the failures of her predecessor, without staining his honor too much. I am not telling you to dismiss Lamprecht outright. But he needs to correct his behavior and augment his skill set if he can be outran or even outsmarted, by a six year old boy.”</p><p>“That is-”</p><p>She leveled one of her most stern glares towards her son, as she saw he was still hesitating to follow her advice.</p><p>“We do not have much time to think about this, Sylvester! If you have anyone more suited for the role, please, do tell me who you have in mind.”</p><p>Of course the answer was silence, it did not take long after that until he finally broke down and voiced his agreement. He summoned his other retainers back and he agreed to meet the girl in four day’s time. It was no more than a formalarity at this point, so she ordered her own attendants to inform young Rozemyne’s family of the agreed upon date. She could not help but wear a satisfied smile, as she returned to her chambers. Now she only needed to deal with that annoying Florencia and the Leisegangs. But first she had to arrange for another meeting.</p><p>She now had to meet with young Rozemyne’s mother, as agreed upon. Of course it was not a matter of simply asking the woman, but not having a meeting would just be plain rude. She arranged for the meeting to be in just two days to highlight its urgency. Drehgarnuhr spun her weave with frightening speed until it was time for her meeting with Roselinde.</p><p>“Lady Veronica, what a rare treat to be able to meet with you. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of life?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>She decided to simply ease into the conversation for now. It would be interesting how Roselinde would react.</p><p>“I do hope that Dauerleben kept you well since I saw you at your daughter’s baptism, Roselinde. I can see you took well to the role of Wiegenmilch.”</p><p>“I have indeed, Lady Veronica. And may I say your hair is just as lustrous as it was that day.”</p><p>So they were jumping straight into somewhat relevant topics instead of the usual banter? She would normally feel insulted but this faster pace suited her just fine, as there was still so much to prepare. Perhaps Roselinde at least managed to pick up on the urgency of her summons.</p><p>“Isn’t it so? It seems your house has been blessed by Kunstzeal in more ways than one. Your daughter’s performance at her debut was as pleasing to the ear as the sight of the envious Leisengangs was to the eye. It pleases me to see the young generation of my faction thrive.”</p><p>“The reactions to her performance were quite notable indeed. My husband was similarly touched by her talent when he heard her practice. In fact, he lamented the fact that he could not keep her talents for his own ears alone.”</p><p>She did not even need to fake her smile upon hearing those words, as she could vividly imagine this boisterous man in her mind's eye. The similarities to her brother in law were startling and hard to miss.</p><p>“My my, I can indeed picture Guthfried being so protective of his only daughter.”</p><p>She signaled for a change of tea, if Roselinde wanted a fast pace she would act in a similar fashion.</p><p>“A sweet sentiment indeed, but as you are aware, Roselinde, it is not a thought that can be entertained. Such talent must be shared to benefit the duchy.”</p><p>“But of course Lady Veronica, I have told him as much myself. It is my hope that this talent will allow Rozemyne to bring honor to Ehrenfest at the Royal Academy. Perhaps it does not belong to Schlaftraum’s realm to think that she could even be invited to the music professors’ tea party.”</p><p>How ambitious of her, but she could not really argue against it. Rozemyne’s talent would undoubtedly be instantly recognized. But she would be a fool not to note the obvious attempt to derail the focus of their talks to the future, and not the reasons for this meeting. So she decided to redirect the conversation.</p><p>“Oh Roselinde, there is still so much time until your daughter enters the Academy. Indeed, who is to say what patterns Ventuchte has woven for her future, but there is much benefit that she can bring to our great duchy even before then.”</p><p>It seemed little Rozemyne had not learned her outstanding bearing from her mother, as Roselinde was subtly tensing up upon hearing her reply.</p><p>“My, to think you would hold our house in such high esteem that we could bring benefit to the duchy. Still, young shoulders need time to grow and be nurtured to be able to carry such lofty expectations.”</p><p>Was the daughter truly so much more advanced than her mother? It was near laughably easy to counter those arguments. She began to sharpen her smile at Roselinde before speaking again.</p><p>“And what better way for the young sprouts to be nourished than to support each other under the Goddess of Light’s rays?”</p><p>“I am so glad you agree, Lady Veronica. My dear Rozemyne is already attending training with some fellow apprentice knights to allow her to grow together with her peers.”</p><p>This was just playing into her narrative so she relaxed her smile and gave a soft nod towards the woman.</p><p>“A wise decision on your part, however I fear her peers are benefiting much more than your daughter can be from spending time with those who are so inferior to her. Why, I believe most of the apprentice knights are mednobles and below, or follow those accursed Florencia and Elvira. If Rozemyne wishes to grow, she will need to face a challenge soon. After all, Angriff rarely blesses knights who avoid Gluckitat’s trials.”</p><p>“The other children may not even reach her level, that is true, but I believe as her Erwachlehren, Lord Bonifatius invokes Gluckitat more than enough to bring the notice of Anwachs and Angriff to my daughter. Their battles are something to behold indeed.”</p><p>So she was bringing the oaf up already? To be fair he would most likely be the biggest impediment to her plans, what with his stupid sense of honor and chivalry. Such archaic concepts.</p><p>“Very good, very good indeed. It pleases me to hear that her accomplishments were enough to catch the attention of even my dear brother in law. In fact, she did not escape the notice of my son either. As Bonifatius is the father of his own head knight, my son has been waiting for a talented individual to catch his uncle’s attention, an apprentice knight who would then surely be worthy of serving the future archduke. Just as Karsted was trained by his father to be worthy of serving my son, now that your daughter was selected as the next knight to receive the honor of being his disciple, Bonifatius will now train her to be the head knight of my grandson.”</p><p>Roselinde kept her smile as she decided to deflect into the future. Again.</p><p>“That is a great honor indeed. To think my daughter would have such a high position she could accept after her graduation, I am certain all other apprentice knights will be envious of her for having the possibility.”</p><p>She decided to get a little bit more forceful now, to finally concentrate on current events in full.</p><p>“Oh I believe as Wilfried’s Leidenschaft, by the time they both graduate from the Academy, the apprentice knights will come to know her as their commander under Wilfried’s instruction. She has no need to fear the envy of those below her when the future archduke leads the dorm with her by his side.”</p><p>“Oh my, Lady Veronica, are you already offering my daughter a position in Lord Wilfried’s entourage once he enters the Academy? My that is a most generous offer, one that Rozemyne will surely have to train hard for over the next few years to be worthy of. After all, I could not bear the shame it would bring to your faction to announce a child at a mere seven years as your esteemed heir’s knight for her talent, only for her to fall short in her training before taking up such a high position.”</p><p>She was beginning to become annoyed by Roselinde’s constant pitiful attempts at evasion. This very same seven year old daughter of hers had proven herself far more skilled in the subtleties a lady must possess than her mother so far.</p><p>“Dear me, Grammaratur appears to be playing her tricks on us. You have no need to fear such easily avoidable consequences, Roselinde. The simple solution is for little Rozemyne to begin acting as Wilfried’s knight at once, while her talent, even noticed by Bonifatius, is well known among both children and nobles. Her fellow retainers, and of course her Erwachlehren can then make sure that she does not fall behind in her duties. I will even allow her to share Kunstzeal’s blessing with my dear grandson.”</p><p>Maybe now she would finally stop to procastrate the inevitable? It was maybe a bit more direct than she would have liked, but she was starting to lose some of her patience with the woman.</p><p>“Goodness me, Lady Veronica, what a generous offer! I am nearly bereft of Grammaratur’s blessing. As gracious as this offer is from you, I do fear that Ordoschnelli may have gotten carried away in her praise of my daughter. She is indeed remarkable for such a small child, but I shudder to think of how she would stand up to a trained knight as she tried to defend her charge, small as she is now! Do forgive me, Lady Veronica, but to think Lord Wilfried could be seen under the protection of a little girl? No matter how much faith I may have in my daughter’s abilities, I don’t dare to think she could protect Lord Wilfried if attempts on his life were encouraged by an apparent lack of protection!”</p><p>‘...Is she seriously saying that? The girl is already known for sparring with my brother in law! Is she trying to mock Gebordnung and Ordoschnelli in the same breath?!’</p><p>“Roselinde, Roselinde, Roselinde… To see you insult the capabilities of my brother in law in such a manner hurts me deeply. Do you mean to imply that a mere knight would be so above Bonifatius in combat skill that your daughter, his disciple who he personally trains near daily, could not keep up?”</p><p>“Perish the thought! I must beg your forgiveness if my words even as much as implied such an insult! Of course, there is no match for Lord Bonifatius, and as such my daughter should be able to at the very least spar with any knight for some time. I merely worry that she could be easily outnumbered, as she has only sparred one on one in her training sessions. And while those who have seen her at training know that she is already a dependable knight, some fools could underestimate her and plot against Lord Wilfried thinking he is unprotected.”</p><p>She decided to put an end to that annoying evasion of hers, so she let her smile fade into a stern frown.</p><p>“So you do see that she is a dependable knight who can match any opponent. Good. If her presence can draw out the traitors in our dutchy while my grandson is still under the protection of the Supreme Couple, even better. I trust you understand that he would, of course, be protected by more than just your daughter in his entourage, as well as the castle guards. I believe that puts all your worries to rest.”</p><p>The lack of response from Roselinde indicated she had finally put her evasion attempts to rest. The woman looked visibly distressed so she relaxed her own features into a more gentle expression before offering the benefits she was willing to grant them.</p><p>“There are, of course benefits to a child so close to my grandson in age becoming his retainer so early. As I mentioned, I shall allow young Rozemyne to share the blessings of Kunstzeal with Wilfried. As the only child close to his age he will interact with until joining the winter play room, I expect the two of them to grow closer as she instructs him in the art of harspiel and music. Your family is a branch to the archducal clan itself. It is time you strengthen these ties. The role of Flutraine is not too far for your daughter to reach, should Greifechan and Anhaltung bless her.”</p><p>“I… I do believe you have settled my anxious heart, Lady Veronica. I thank you ever so much. It will be our honor to have our daughter serve as Lord Wilfried’s Leidenschaft. Anything beyond that at this age… her shoulder may be too small for such a heavy cape.”</p><p>It was tragic indeed that she needed to nearly order the woman to receive Greifechan’s blessing for her own family. It was more heavy handed then she intended to be at first but she was just annoyed at this point.</p><p>“I suggest you both pray to Anwachs to grow her shoulders with haste, then, as Dregarnuhr will wait for no one. In fact, she has already woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace.”</p><p>She dismissed the woman, who bowed to her before leaving the room. After this tiresome meeting she decided to head straight to her hidden room. She would not have expected for Roselinde to show this level of resistance. Did she not realize the massive amount of favor she was receiving? But in the end she decided to dismiss it from her thoughts, she had secured her newest piece on the gewinnen board.</p><p>Young Rozemyne would make a fine addition to her collection, she had no doubt that the girl would succeed in her mission. Saving Wilfried from humiliation was just the first step. When the time was right she would demand from the girl to create her own namestone before presenting it to her. She would never allow such a promising talent to escape her grasp. She was truly blessed by Greifechan that the girl had so far evaded the notice of her rivaling faction. She did not even want to imagine the headache her falling into Florencia’s hands would have caused. Rozemyne serving that lowly wife’s daughter would have been a nightmare to deal with, just because of that oaf training her alone.</p><p>She smiled to herself. At last, everything was now back to how it should be. For her to control and manipulate to her heart's content.</p>

    <p>The meeting with Veronica was as surprising as it was ultimately predictable. She even tried to pressure her right at the beginning, withholding acknowledgement of her greeting for longer than was appropriate, what a cheap tactic. Of course such paltry tricks did not work on her. She was more holding herself back from outright laughing at it than feeling any form of pressure. She did not expect for Oswald to be present in the meeting but as he was now her uncle it made sense for the woman to seek to exploit this potential weakness to further pressure her, so she made sure to make it clear they were estranged at best.</p><p>It was laughably easy to run laps around the bumbling buffoon, but Veronica herself was striking a picture of competency she would not have expected from the old trombe of Ehrenfest, seeing the level of her minions. In hindsight it made sense for her to be at least this competent. How else could the woman have built her small kingdom inside of the duchy? She would have to be somewhat competent to achieve this level of control. </p><p>She carefully moderated her rhetoric to contain just the right amount of humbleness and asskissing. Which seemed to work reasonably well on the woman. She knew she could not openly defy Veronica as an archnoble in her faction, and she had kind of expected to be used to fix Wilfried anyhow, so it was no surprise for her. She had hoped she could at least use her gender as an excuse, but had to admit it was a shaky argumentation at best. The main problem was she just had no real arguments or power to refuse, and not even offering to become a “spy” seemed to work.</p><p>Which was somewhat disappointing really, she had hoped to play the spy to eventually infiltrate the Florencia faction and maybe even feed <em> them </em>some information. Or if that would not work she could at least see her angel Charlotte again. Oh sure she would have had to serve her this time, but that only meant she would be even closer! It was too bad that the avenue was simply brushed aside, which was indicative that Veronica had no intention to “share” her with anyone else. It was most likely near impossible now to gain any form of neutrality, let alone change factions.</p><p>At least she was successful in diverting any attention from her former temple staff. She felt kind of bad for badmouthing them like that, but they would escape notice that way, so it was worth it in the end. Even if she had to shine more attention upon herself. The only real surprise was when she was offered to become Wilfried’s third or second wife as a possible “reward”. Just how delusional was Veronica, offering only things that benefited her alone, dressed as rewards. Maybe this would have worked with someone of lower standing, but even as an archnoble she was the heir of her house. Being offered what she did simply didn’t have that much of an appeal. Maybe Veronica simply had not much experience in dealing with archnobles?</p><p>She had to suppress a pained groan as the talks finally came to an end. It seemed that being tied to Wilfried, and the possibility of becoming his fiance, was an inescapable path for her to tread. At least she was able to get some benefits out of it this time, as small as they were. She noted that Veronica was more willing to give her concessions than her description in the past would have led her to believe. Was it because of desperation, or was there some other reason she could just not see at the moment? She did nonetheless inform her parents of even the smallest happenings and information she had gleaned from the sudden invitation from Veronica. Her mother looked anxious but ultimately agreed that a meeting between her and Veronica could not be avoided. She promised to try her best to at the very least delay the start of her employment. Rozemyne didn’t have the heart to tell her that the chances of that were near zero.</p><p>On the date of the meeting between her mother and Veronica she busied herself with some light exercises in their training yard. The activity was doing much to free her mind of any unnecessary thoughts. She was in the process of switching between hands during her one handed pushups when she was informed by a worried looking Jenni, that her mother had returned from the meeting with Veronica. She let a worried frown grow on her face, her mother not immediately seeking her out to tell her the results of those talks was unusual. She asked her only present attendant, Mathilde, as Tuuliane had briefly returned to her adopted family, to fix her appearance and then made her way towards her mother’s chambers. Her arrival seemed to greatly relieve her mother’s own attendants, who immediately showed their distress.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, thank the heavens you are here! Please help us. Lady Roselinde just wordlessly entered her hidden room, dismissing all of us before closing the entrance. We fear for the worst, our lady looked most distressed after the tea party.”</p><p>She did her best to calm the rambling women, before making her way to the entrance of her mother’s hidden room herself. She told Mathilde to remain outside before using the small medallion she was given to allow her entrance in case of emergency to enter the hidden room of her mother.</p><p>The first thing that hit her upon her entrance was the sound of tearful sobbing, and the fact the table used for their own private meetings was toppled over. She looked at the source of the noises and finally found her mother, curled into herself in the corner. She was grabbing onto a small cushion, while crying her eyes out, mumbling words she could not understand due to the distance between them.</p><p>She did not waste anymore time and moved towards her beloved mother as fast as Steifebriese, before giving her a wordless hug. Roselinde was startled at first, looking for the source of sudden contact. But as soon as she saw who was hugging her she grabbed onto Rozemyne in near desperation, pulling her into her bosom. In her new position she was finally able to understand her mothers ramblings. She was begging for her forgiveness, saying that she was a failure of a mother, over and over again.</p><p>Seeing her like this, made her blood boil in anger. It was only the fact that her anger could be misinterpreted by the crying woman holding onto her like her life dependent on it, that let her refrain from showing it openly. Instead she began to readjust their current position. Moving slightly out of the near death grip of her mother, momentarily increasing her distress, before taking Roselinde’s head and putting it on her own chest. She may not yet have enough cushioning herself, but the action seemed to greatly calm her mother down, as Rozemyne began to sing a calming lullaby to her. She began to stroke her mother’s head, letting her fingers flow through the jade-colored locks of Roselinde. It may have looked strange to anyone else, seeing a fully grown woman being comforted like a small girl by her own seven year old daughter, but she did not care in the least. Her mom needed to be comforted more than anything else right now. For the first time since discovering the effects of her singing voice, she was glad for them. Her mother’s sobbing was reduced to mere hiccups in no time at all. She continued to sing, even when she was sure that her mom had entered Schlaftraum’s realm. It was only when she saw that her dad had entered the room, looking at them both with tears in his eyes that she ended her singing.</p><p>Her dad wordlessly took her mother into his arms with great care, and began to carry her towards the double bed in the room and placed her on it. She was about to give them some space, but her father was faster. He lifted her up by grabbing her under her armpits, before placing her beside Roselinde on the bed. As if sensing her closeness her mom grabbed onto her body, pulling her closer to seek its warmth. Her dad moved to lay down on her other side, sandwiching Rozemyne between both of her parents, but she did not mind those actions at all. All of this reminded her of the old dynamic of her family in the last weave, when she was just a simple commoner and not a noble, so very, very long ago. She closed her own eyes and began to bask in the warm comfort of familial love.</p><p>As she rose from her unplanned slumber she noticed that she was the first of them to leave Schlaftraum’s realm. She decided to snuggle more into her mothers embrace. But her movements had apparently woken her father up, who gave her a few pats on her head before whispering.</p><p>“Thank you for taking care of your mother in my stead, Rozemyne. You are such a good girl, I can not thank the gods enough for allowing me to be your father.”</p><p>His words struck deeper than he ever could have intended. Maybe it was truly a boon from those incompetent gods, meant to appease her in some roundabout way? As she pondered over the sudden thought she noticed her mother was showing signs of awakening too, so she let her thoughts rest for a moment and looked up at her mother’s face with as much love as she could currently portray. What mother would not love to wake up, seeing her children looking at them lovingly? It was perhaps a little manipulative of her, but her mother needed any form of reassurance and affection to get over whatever resulted in her previous breakdown.</p><p>As Roselinde woke up she blinked drowsily at her, it took her a few moments to get her bearings but as she became aware of what she was looking at her eyes widened and she let out a squeal of happiness and pressed her even further into her body.</p><p>“Ah, my adorable daughter is so cute!”</p><p>…That was not the reaction she had expected but it would work too. They spent a few more minutes like that, her mom fussing over her cuteness and her dad merely looking at the scene lovingly. It was not until her mom changed her grip to press her face into her breast that she began to give any form of resistance, tapping her hands on Roselinde’s arms repeatedly.</p><p>“Mwom! legwme gwo!”</p><p>“Ah, I am sorry!”</p><p>After being freed from her near suffocation, they all got up and started to gather themselves. Guthfried refused to let go of her mother as soon as he took her into his arms, letting her sit sideways in his lap, much to her embarrassment. They then discussed the results of the meeting between Roselinde and Veronica. As she expected, she was drafted into teaching Wilfried and becoming his knight in the near future. After assuring her apologetic mother she was fine with it, and telling her not to worry herself so much, she gave her one last hug before leaving the hidden room. </p><p>On her way out she told her mother she would be going out to train, it may have been a white lie. She did not intend to use the training grounds available to her, she needed to destroy something to vent right now. She passed the borders of the estate after picking up her training sword, which was really just called that for some reason, as it was a working weapon, and made her way into the noble part of the forest.</p><p>Here, free from any judging eye she relaxed her features, her noble smile dropping from her face to make place for a fierce scowl. She channeled her mana to activate her enhancement magic and punched the nearest tree with as much force as she could muster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Seeing the trunk flying into the opposite direction from her did not help to alleviate her growing anger, but she faintly noticed she had gone overboard again. The tree had just now collided with another and was in the process of creating a sort of domino effect.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The phenomenon reminded her that she had to prepare more from now on. It seemed she truly needed to form some sort of powerbase now, being in the background was no longer an option with Veronica’s growing interference in her life. She would start with the merchants first, and maybe take another look at this ledger of her little excursion, which resulted in Wolf’s demise. The evidence inside of it would prove most useful in blackmailing certain parties perhaps? </p><p>She shook her head and decided to ignore those thoughts for now and stride further down into the forest. It did not take long for a middle sized feybeast to approach her position. She swung her sword lazily in its direction, without stopping her angry march further into the wilderness. Curiously, she found that the blood on her face, resulting from the dissection of the creature that had attacked her, was not bothering her in the slightest. If anything, killing the creature was raising her mood slightly. As she picked up the feystone of the beast she had slain absentmindedly, she could not help herself as a troubling thought made itself known to her.</p><p>‘Did I fall prey to some innate bloodlust or something?’</p><p>She continued her journey into the woods, while watching her surroundings. Except for the noises of the forest it was peaceful, too peaceful. The next steps took her to a little clearing, still in the shade of the surrounding trees, with a little rock formation in its center. She curiously approached the small formation of stone or rubble. But before she could further analyze the strange formation of rocks in front of her, she became aware that she was not alone in the clearing any longer. She looked around to find what had triggered her subconscious awareness.</p><p>It was a small swarm of cat-like creatures, or zantzes, closing in all around her. The feybeasts were not bigger than the usual housecat, but were much more aggressive in comparison. Most likely they were after her abundant pool of mana. She smiled. It seemed they thought about her as their prey, she would have to remedy those foolish thoughts. If she could not crush Veronica or any other problem before her for now, maybe these beasts would do instead. She upped her enhancement to her current peak, just below the need required for a battle song, and began to wait, her blade ready at her side and hungry for the blood to be spilled.</p><p>She did not have to wait long as it seemed they had just decided to attack her all at once, she was being assaulted from every side. Before any of them could reach her she began her deadly dance of carnage, as she began to spin her body. Her blade, following along with her graceful movements, cutting anything approaching her into two. The resulting sprays of blood only seemed to further drive those creatures into their frenzy. She was faintly reminded of a similar event in her past, but she had been a mere bystander at the time, letting fully grown adult knights deal with them instead of by her own hands.</p><p>She faintly noticed that it was much easier than she had expected it to be. Not even two minutes after the start of her dance, it was already over. The ground around her was littered with small feystones, and body parts. All of those caked in blood and gore, curiously some of them were still alive. She watched with morbid curiosity as they attempted to crawl away from her, while bleeding out from her inflicted cuts. Were they not so eager to contest her supremacy before?</p><p>She was distracted again by a subdued hiss to her side, causing her to look in its direction. She saw that there was one single zantze that remained unharmed. As she moved to slay the last remainder of the attack she watched with even more curiosity as it began to back away from her in fright, but never letting her out of its sight. Which spelled its doom as it found itself pushed into a massive hollowed out stump of a tree, cornering it with no way to escape. She raised her blade slightly to finish it off, expecting it to attack her in its obvious desperation, but it surprised her again. This one was apparently fairly intelligent as it began to crouch down, while tucking its tail between its feet. She blinked as she also noticed it had flattened its own ears, while shaking slightly.</p><p>She faintly remembered, reading a book about house cats expressing similar behavior in her life as Urano, so long ago.</p><p>It was described as a sign of submission or fear, if she remembered correctly. Was this zantze submitting to her? She looked at its eye’s next, and true to her assessment they were diluted, looking up to her in obvious fear and terror. How curious. She lowered her blade to her side again, before looking at it more closely. It had midnight coloured fur, not that dissimilar to her own hair, but its eyes were a bright green.</p><p>She gave the small creature one last look before deciding to spare it. She made her way back to the sight of the slaughter and began to pick up the widely scattered feystones. She would have to cleanse them in addition to herself. All of that blood and the body parts were too unhygienic to remain on her person or new collection, to say the least. She did not even want to consider her mother’s wrath if she saw her like this. She was nearly done with collecting the spoils of her labor as she noticed the small zantze she had spared was approaching her cautiously.</p><p>She nearly raised her weapon again until she noticed it was nudging small feystones in her direction, before backing a short distance away. Watching her for any kind of reaction. She was taken aback, was it offering those stones to her?</p><p>“Are those for me?”</p><p>The small zantze moved to the small pile of stones, giving them a slight push towards her, before backing away again. She smiled at the frankly adorable sight. It was so cute to watch, now she was glad to have spared it for this moment alone. She approached the pile and added them to her collection, inside of her pouch. Afterwards she gave a nod at the adorable feline.</p><p>“My thanks.”</p><p>She began to leave the clearing, after that amusing interaction she made her way even deeper into the woods. It did not take long until she discovered another feybeast, a vildshwein. The creature looked like an oversized boar with two horns on its head, in addition to its normal tusks in its mouth. She did not falter in her steps as it roared and began to charge at her. Just before it was about to hit her she simply performed an elegant spin to her right, keeping her blade horizontal at chesthight. The move effortlessly bisected the beast in two, before resulting in a feystone clattering to the ground. All of the blood in the clearing was probably drawing the attention of other beasts, so she picked up the stone and hurried along slightly faster than before.</p><p>Her senses warned her that she was being watched, and as she looked for the source of the feeling, she saw a small shadow escaping in the underbrush. It was curious, but she decided against pursuing her little stalker and instead pressed on. She faintly noticed that it was feeling colder than before as a high pitched squeal drew her attention to her left. It was a small shumil, desperately running for its life in her direction. She had no need to wonder what spooked the small feybeast as she saw its hunter appear just behind it in pursuit. The predator had seemingly become aware of her presence too and had a change of mind, deciding that she would make a better meal. Keeping its momentum, its eyes had focused on her instead of its previous prey, it jumped at her in an attempt to tackle her.</p><p>She simply remained calm and repeated the same motion she had used to kill the vildshwein previously. Sadly, this predator was proving more resilient as she merely inflicted a big gash, spilling its lifeblood instead of cutting it in half outright. As she finished her spin she finally got a good look at her newest assailant. It was a snow white tiger-like beast – no, more like some form of white saber-tooth. It eerily reminded her of the Lord of Winter she had finished in the previous weave, only much smaller and with shorter teeth. Maybe it was a lesser variant of the schnesturm of her memories? It was still kind of impressive in size, towering well beyond her height, she guessed it would be just short of three meters standing upright maybe?</p><p>As the beast rose to its feet again, after tumbling to the ground at its failed jumping attack, it growled at her in apparent anger. The deep sound was able to be felt even from her current distance. She noticed the shumil was seeking refuge between her legs, shaking terribly. She paid it no further mind as she began to slowly advance towards the smaller version of the schnesturm in measured steps. She could not help herself as a bloodthirsty grin began to form on her face – maybe this would prove some form of challenge finally? She was disappointed with her previous encounters so far.</p><p>Her mood dropped slightly as the white beast seemed to tense up suddenly, its growls switching in tune as it suddenly took a wary step away from her. She did not offer it a single moment to change its mind as she used her enhancement to speedily charge at the beast, slashing at its left front leg with all of her current strength. The move cleanly separated the leg from its body, the erupting fountain of blood drenching her slightly. She ignored the pained howl of the beast and used the same move again to sever another leg, the right hindleg this time, before it could respond to her attacks. As the crippled feybeast crumbled to the ground, her grin turned into a frown. She had so high expectations for this fight only to be utterly disappointed.</p><p>By the Gods, the once mighty beast was currently whimpering and trying to escape from her, using its remaining limbs to crawl away while gushing blood from its wounds. It was not even trying to attack her anymore. It was a sad sight to see. She lost nearly any drive to finish it off, but letting it suffer was too cruel too. With her decision made she jumped at the beast and used her mana enhancement to kick it in its side. The force of her attack sent the smaller schnesturm colliding into the nearest tree with a loud crash.</p><p>After she landed from her airborne kick, she made her way over to the whimpering predator – now her prey, and looked into its fear-filled eyes before thrusting her blade into its brain, killing it instantly. She took a moment to look at the now dead body before deciding against even attempting to butcher it for materials. She simply had no experience in it or knowledge of which parts would even be useful, so she began blindly stabbing a few times at its torso. Her fourth swing seemed to do the trick as the massive body began to melt at a fast pace, leaving only a large feystone behind. After pocketing the stone she looked at her surroundings again. The feeling of being watched was back again, but she could not make out its source this time, all this blood on the ground did most likely not help.</p><p>She decided to make her way back home, she was already out for longer than she had planned. This was just supposed to be a small trip to blow off some steam but the fifth bell had rung a while ago. She noticed she was being followed, but paid it no mind as that was expected in a forest full of aggressive feybeasts. As long as they left her in peace she would not go out of her way to kill them right now. The other fights were disappointing enough.</p><p>She was nearly at the edge of the forest when her senses told her that her stalker was finally approaching her. She was taken aback, as it was the very same zantze from before! The small thing had apparently followed her all the way to here, and was currently assuming the same submissive posture as before but without the previous signs of fear.</p><p>She hummed softly, before raising her left hand above it and making a spinning motion with her finger. The feybeast, which had slightly tensed up as she raised her hand, reacted to her vague gesture instantly and followed her finger, performing a spin before assuming its previous position, she smiled in return.</p><p>“You sure are a bright one aren’t you? I guess you can have a treat.”</p><p>She took out one of the small feystones she collected previously and dyed it with her mana. She repeated the gesture, causing it to repeat its spinning before looking at her again.</p><p>“Good, Good, excellently done.”</p><p>She offered the dyed stone towards the feline, who devoured her inlaid mana greedily. The interaction caused her smile to widen. The offering of mana had apparently lowered its guard slightly. She lowered herself to one knee, and reached a hand out towards the zantze. She knelt there, unmoving, allowing the little feybeast to come to her on its own terms. The zantze hesitated, freezing up at even the smallest movements, clearly still scared of someone so powerful, but eventually made its way to her extended hand. The creature sniffed her carefully, watching her with big round eyes. Eventually, it seemed to decide she was safe to be near, and rubbed its cheek against her hand, closing its eyes softly in the meanwhile.</p><p>“Is that nice? You are quite adorable…”</p><p>She moved her hand slowly to be able to scratch the little zantze’s head, which seemed to bask in the feeling. She petted the animal for a while before taking her arm back, bending it at the elbow and offering her left forearm towards it, while tapping it a few times with her right hand. Bright as it was it seemingly understood her intention as it jumped onto her offered arm, before trying to stabilize itself onto it.</p><p>“Very good, you are truly bright indeed.”</p><p>She rose back up before pulling her arm into the direction of her body, resulting in the zantze to adjust its place of rest in her arms. She realized that her previous anger was all but forgotten, she was not even sure if it was because of the slaughter or her adorable new pet zantze. It did not take long for her to decide it was most definitely because of her new pet, a much less alarming reason than the other option. She began to resume the trek towards her home. She allowed for some of her concentration to shift towards the zantze in her arm – obviously it needed a name now that it was on the way to become hers.</p><p>She gave the creature a few scratches behind the ear, causing purring approval of her actions before stopping and readjusting her grip on the feline, holding it slightly before her. After inspecting it for a few moments it was apparent it was a female, so she searched for any obvious signs of inspiration for a name. Her search was short lived as her focus settled on the eyes of her furry companion, those jade green eyes seemed to watch her curiously in return. Her smile widened as she settled for a new name faster than expected.</p><p>“I know, you will be Hisui! Just like your eyes.”</p><p>“Mew.”</p><p>“You like it? Ah, such a good girl!”</p><p>She nested Hisui back into her arms, while scratching her ears or patting her head, causing the feline feybeast to become like putty in her hands, purring in delight. Such an adorable sight! It was not until her return that she realized how much time she had spent in the forest as her father was standing in the entrance, arms crossed and his stern look switching between her and Hisui multiple times as his expression shifted into fearful worry. She remembered that she was still covered in blood, the whole interaction with Hisui had caused her to forget to cast a cleansing prayer…</p><p>“Father, um I- I can explain!”</p><p>She did not get anymore words in as he summoned his schtappe and cast a simple waschen over her. Now fully cleaned, she was sat down and scolded for the whole incident of her disappearance and the state she had returned in. Meanwhile Hisui was sitting in her lap, being comforted by her irregular head patting. If she could not escape a lecture at least one of them would have a good time with it.</p><p>After the extensive scolding she received surprisingly little resistance to her adoption of her new pet zantze Hisui. If anything her mother was telling her how cute the image of her sitting in Rozemyne’s lap was, voicing no protest at all. Her dad merely asked how it came about, and after hearing how she tamed it gave her a proud nod, as if it was completely normal. She decided to not further think about it and took Hisui with her into her chambers, where she greeted her attendants and placed the small zantze on the ground before crouching before it and looking seriously in its eyes. Hisui apparently understood that she was about to receive commands, as she adopted an attentive stance, looking at her.</p><p>“Hisui, you have already met my parents, but these are my people too.”</p><p>She gestured at every person in her room.</p><p>“All of the people you see here belong to <em> me </em> , so you will <em> not hurt them </em> in <em> any way, </em> do you understand me?”</p><p>“Mew!”</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>She patted the feline on its head before talking again.</p><p>“If you continue to be a good girl you will get more rewards, so do your best.”</p><p>“Mew!”</p><p>She stood up and pointed at her sister.</p><p>“This is Tuuliane, she will take care of you, when I am unable to, so treat her with the respect she deserves.”</p><p>Hisui gave her a confirmative nod, before trotting in Tuuliane’s direction and gave her legs a few playful rubs with her head and body. The adorable sight made everyone around her swoon at the cuteness. So Rozemyne made her way over and praised her pet for a job well done, before giving her more pats and a small feystone of mana as a reward for learning so quickly.</p><p>Dregarnuhr spun her weaving with exceptional speed as it was already the day of her meeting with Sylvester, so she made her way to the playroom with her sister, but did not enter it and remained waiting at the door.</p><p>It did not take long for one of Veronica’s attendants to fetch her. So she bade goodbye to her sister for now and began to follow the woman. As they made their way through the –for her– familiar corridors of the castle, she was once again struck by the weirdness she was preparing to be part of. She would most likely be a precedent again, a pre-academy aged retainer being assigned to a pre-baptised child. And a young girl serving an even younger boy to boot, truly a most strange combination of happenstances. As her mind began to drift into possible opportunities she could use these facts for in the future, they arrived at their destination. She continued to follow her guide inside of the room, where she was instructed to await the arrival of the Archducal family. She thanked her guide, who departed to presumably inform them of her arrival. She did not have to wait long until the guide appeared again, informing her that the Archducal family would now enter, so she kneeled on the floor in the usual subordinate pose expected from any noble, and waited. It didn’t take long for them to enter the room, she waited slightly until everyone had arrived before giving her greetings.</p><p>“I am honored beyond words that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate together once more, Aub Ehrenfest. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of life?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may Aub Ehrenfest and his family be blessed.”</p><p>After finishing the greetings expected of her she rose with as much elegance as she could muster and assumed a perfect noble lady pose, her hands clasped in front of her. It did not take long for Sylvester to begin addressing her.</p><p>“So we meet again, young Rozemyne. My mother told me tales of your supposed achievements in the domains of Kunstzeal and Angriff since your debut.”</p><p>He scrutinized her for a few moments, looking at her with his stern Aub persona.</p><p>“Quite high praise for someone your age. I do hope Ordoschnelli was not too eager to sing pleasing melodies to my mother.”</p><p>She did her best to appear humble as she gave a short nod to him before giving her answer.</p><p>“You honor me Aub Ehrenfest by granting me the opportunity to show my value to you and the Archducal family. It is only through the blessings of Sehweit in Lady Veronica, that I was granted this unexpected boon from Greifechan. I will do my best to prove myself to you.”</p><p>She finished her speech with another short bow, before looking up again. Her words had apparently pleased Veronica, as she was looking at her approvingly. Meanwhile Sylvester appeared to be distracted by something. It was as if he was looking through her, not at her. To her relief it took only a moment until he regained his composure, before addressing her again.</p><p>“Good. You are to become Leidenschaft and Erwachlehren for my oldest son, Wilfried. As you know he has not yet been baptized, and thus you must take utmost care as you accompany him in the castle. Regardless, he is my heir and I expect that you serve him honorably and faithfully. Understood?”</p><p>“Understood, Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>He gestured to Oswald, who stepped up at the signal.</p><p>“This is Oswald, Wilfried’s head attendant. As he is your uncle I believe no further introduction is necessary. You may refer to him for any further information regarding your employment.”</p><p>“I thank you, Aub. I will heed Lord Oswald’s instructions with the gravity they deserve as Lord Wilfried’s most trusted advisor and caretaker.”</p><p>Sylvester gave her a nod of acknowledgement before ending their meeting and dismissing her.</p><p>“Excellent. It seems Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace.”</p><p>She bowed to him before being guided out of the room by Oswald. He began to lead her towards the chambers Wilfried currently resided in. As he was still under Veronica’s care those very same chambers were in the east wing of the castle. As they walked to their destination she was told by Oswald that he would give her a few boards containing any information she would be required to be aware of, when the meeting with Wilfried himself had concluded.</p><p>As they arrived at Wilfried’s chambers she was directly led inside the luxurious room. There were just two other people inside, currently having a hushed conversation, which ceased as they saw them entering the room. They gave short nods in their direction, before dispersing to other tasks. As they reached the middle of the room she was addressed by Oswald again.</p><p>“Please wait here, I will fetch our lord to meet you, niece.”</p><p>“Thank you, uncle Oswald.”</p><p>She assumed her greeting pose again, as she waited for Oswald to return with his young charge – their charge now, she supposed. It still felt weird to her to kneel to Wilfried of all people, but it could not be helped, she was just an archnoble this time around, not his adopted sister. She was taken out of her thoughts as she saw that Wilfried was not slowly walking to her but running at her! To her great relief he stopped his advance just a few steps before her, but she had to refrain from rolling her eyes in exasperation as he was about to address her first, so she began her greetings in a hurry.</p><p>“I am honored beyond words that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate together today, Lord Wilfried. I am called Rozemyne. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of life?”</p><p>“Oh, sure!”</p><p>‘He is even failing at this? This is literally one of the first things you are told about! What are his teachers doing?’</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>After giving her blessing she stood up and looked at her former brother. Oswald had caught up with his charge and was now standing at his right side. She also saw Lamprecht standing slightly further behind at his left. He was scrutinizing her intensively. She was taken out of her observations by Wilfrieds reaction.</p><p>“Woah, you're really pretty.”</p><p>She sent a subtle glance at Oswald, who to his slight credit averted his eyes in apparent unease. She looked at Wilfried again before giving her answer, while smiling demurely.</p><p>“Oh my, you flatter me with your words, Lord Wilfried. Being praised for their abundant blessings of Efflorelume is most pleasing for any lady to hear. But fear not, I am not unfamiliar with the art of Grammaratur, you need not abandon Verbergen’s shroud for my sake. It is best to avoid any misunderstandings, after all. Seeing as I am to become Erwachlehrend in addition to Leidenschaft in your service, it would only attract off-tune Ordoschnelli to fly.”</p><p>“Um… what?”</p><p>She had to suppress the sudden urge to sigh, instead she leveled a stern look at Oswald again, who was still avoiding looking at her! She decided to look at Lamprecht instead, but he was avoiding looking her in the eyes now too! Those cowards!</p><p>“Um maybe you should forgo the dance of Grammaratur for now, Rozemyne?”</p><p>She couldn't restrain herself at Oswald’s plain admittance of his master's incompetence. She did her best to make her voice sound as flat as possible.</p><p>“You mean to say our lord was not instructed in the abundant dancing in Grammaratur, a crucial skill of all noblemen? Was it not your own duty as Erwachlehren to bring Mestionora’s grace, to guide him in his spring days, that he may enter his first steps into summer unburdened?”</p><p>“I- Ahem, that may be going a bit far but…Yes.”</p><p>She looked at him for a little bit more until deciding it was not worth it. Instead she looked at Wilfried again, relaxing her expression into a lady smile once more.</p><p>“I see, very well. Do excuse me Lord Wilfried, I will refrain from burdening you with Grammaratur’s dance for now. Please allow me to become Erwachlehren– ah, a teacher for a moment instead.”</p><p>Wilfried, who had followed their exchange of words with a confused expression, looked at her again before speaking.</p><p>“Burden, what burden are you speaking of?”</p><p>“Do not mind that for now, my lord. Are you allowing me to become Erwachlehren?”</p><p>“Um, alright?”</p><p>“Thank you. I beg your forgiveness but I will try to speak more plainly for now. It seems to me that you did not understand much of what I previously said, is that correct?”</p><p>The young boy looked away, slightly ashamed.</p><p>“No, not really.”</p><p>“Do not fret, Lord Wilfried. It is the missteps of your attendants, not yourself. They merely failed in their duty to become your teachers. It would be expected of you to understand what I just said. To not do so would be dangerous for you in social circles in the near future, and as the one chosen to protect you it would reflect badly on myself, and everyone else that serves you. So it needs to be corrected as soon as possible.”</p><p>He appeared to think about her words until grimacing slightly.</p><p>“But I am the future Aub. Why would I need to worry about what people say? They should know their place.”</p><p>“...It seems your teachings are more flawed than I expected, let me give you an example. Do you know about the Royal academy, Lord Wilfried?”</p><p>His eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>“Yes! I was told about it, it is the place you will go to when you reach the age of ten, to learn cool stuff like becoming a knight, and a true noble.”</p><p>“Exactly, it is a place for learning and becoming a true noble, but this is not true only for our duchy, Ehrenfest. Noble children attend from every Duchy of Yurgenschmidt. Of course as the future archduke your power will be of great influence inside Ehrenfest, but you have to think about your standing in the whole country too.”</p><p>He was following her words with rapt attention, which was good.</p><p>“Ehrenfest is not ranked highly in the current hierarchy, we are placed in the middle of the current ranking to be exact. Think about them in the terms of laynobles, mednobles, archnobles and archdukes. Our ranking would mean even as the future Aub you would merely be a mednoble in terms of authority between the other archduke candidates in the Royal Academy.”</p><p>He looked at her in light shock.</p><p>“You will not face much trouble here in Ehrenfest, but at the Academy you would be judged by those above your station, so it is important that you arm yourself with the knowledge and skill to beat, or at the very least evade any opponents you may encounter in your stay there.”</p><p>“I see, so you are saying if I am not told about how to understand what is said to me, I will not even know I am being attacked, and can be beaten at the Academy?” </p><p>She nodded at him with a smile.</p><p>“Exactly, Lord Wilfried. That is precisely what I meant to tell you, but we got slightly off track in our conversation. Do you want to know what I said in the beginning of our meeting now?”</p><p>“Yes, please!”</p><p>She nodded at him again.</p><p>“After you praised my appearance I tried to make it known that I appreciate the compliment, but as I am your retainer you must try to hide your compliments towards me, or any lady for that matter better. They could be used to hurt your reputation, as showing your favor towards any girl that openly could be interpreted very badly by others.”</p><p>He nodded at her, apparently thinking about what she just said deeply.</p><p>“I see."</p><p>“I also made a reference to my role inside of your entourage. It was decided by Aub Ehrenfest himself that I will become your teacher in learning to play the harspiel and the necessary skills in singing.”</p><p>He looked at her with slight dismay now.</p><p>“But I do not like to play it…”</p><p>“Forgive me for being blunt with you, but what your desires are on the matter are irrelevant. It was your father, the Aub, who decreed so. So you will learn to play it, and I will do my best to teach you.”</p><p>He was openly grimacing now but did not refute her words any further.</p><p>“In addition, it was decreed by our Aub that I will replace Lord Lamprecht as your new head knight. But that can wait until you finish your debut. I will do my best to learn from him anything that is required to fulfill my assigned duties.”</p><p>“You will replace Lamprecht? But I like him. And you are a girl! You could not possibly be better than him. I will not allow it!”</p><p>“Again your opinion on the matter is irrelevant, Lord Wilfried. It was the decision of our Aub, please remember that your words could be taken as rebellious, or even treasonous. So please refrain from uttering anything similar in the future.”</p><p>He looked at her in shock, his eyes betraying his surprise.</p><p>“T- treason? But I-”</p><p>“Yes, treason, so please just accept his orders and do not question Aub Ehrenfest orders openly ever again, Lord Wilfried. If you have complaints about his decision, bring it up with Lady Veronica or your father in a more private setting, but not before your retainers, or anyone else for that matter. It could have grave consequences for everyone involved.”</p><p>“I will speak with Grandmother then!”</p><p>She simply nodded at him.</p><p>“Indeed that is the best course of action, Lord Wilfried. But if I may voice my humble opinion. I do not believe it will change anything.”</p><p>He did not reply outright, but instead looked at Oswald instead. Who nodded his head in answer.</p><p>“My dear niece is correct, my Lord. It was decreed by Aub Ehrenfest just before we arrived, and Lady Veronica was the one who recommended Rozemyne in the first place. Please trust in your grandmother’s decisions, she only wants what is best for you.”</p><p>“So she is your niece, Oswald?”</p><p>“Indeed, young Rozemyne is the daughter of my sister, Roselinde. Our family is most proud of her and her recent accomplishments. But I believe this enough for now, my Lord. I still need to give my niece the information she requires to be able to serve you better. May I suggest you talk with her more after she has had the time to study them?”</p><p>Wilfried in turn just nodded and looked at her again.</p><p>“I have much to think about, thank you for your honest words, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She bowed her head at him in return.</p><p>“Do not worry about thanking me, Lord Wilfried. It is my duty to advise and serve you from now on.”</p><p>Now that their initial greeting was completed she was taken into another room, where she received the promised boards with instructions. Apart from general information she had to memorize it included the times she was expected to begin her teaching duties. She was to teach him every day, except Earth- and Waterday from fifth bell to sixth bell. The rest of the time she was free to attend the winter playroom. The schedule would be changed after spring arrived to give her room for her training lessons with Bonifatius and the additional freetime she requested. All in all it was acceptable work hours in contrast to her previous workload at this age in the past, so she had no reason to complain.</p><p>After looking over the boards, if there were any questions to ask she found none of immediate import and was allowed to leave for today. One of her new colleagues escorted her back to the playroom, where she reunited with her sister.</p><p>Tuuliane was currently in an animated discussion with Angelica and Lieseleta, all of them were so into it they did not even notice her approach until she was nearly beside them.</p><p>“Ah, Lady Rozemyne blessed be Drehgarnuhr, to allow us to meet again!”</p><p>She gave a nod at her former knight and received the others greetings to her in kind. She did not expect Angelica of all people to request a meeting before anything else could be said.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, may I take a moment of your time? Preferably under the cover of Verbergen, if possible?”</p><p>She faintly noticed that Lieseleta was watching anxiously, but did nothing to interfere. So she decided to at the very least hear her old knight out before making any kind of judgment.</p><p>“My, how daring, Angelica. Do you require a simple tool or do you prefer the full blessing of Verbergen?”</p><p>The airheaded apprentice knight shook her head slightly, before giving her answer.</p><p>“There is not really any tool needed, just a private setting would be enough for the matter.”</p><p>She glanced unsurely at Lieseleta, who nodded at her.</p><p>“I… was told it would be preferable for anyone involved to secure your agreement first, and a private room would be more um… advantageous… for both of us, should you disagree?”</p><p>She gave the girl a small smile before giving her answer.</p><p>“Your struggles in Grammaratur are as endearing as always, Angelica.”</p><p>“Thank you, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>“That was not a compliment, sister…”</p><p>She looked at Lieseleta, who was struggling to contain her exasperation at her older sister.</p><p>“Do not worry yourself, Lieseleta. I do mean it when I say it is endearing, I do not mind it at all.”</p><p>The green eyed girl gave her a polite nod in acceptance.</p><p>“I will trust in your benevolence, Lady Rozemyne. We are most grateful for your leniency.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Sister…”</p><p>“Ah! I am sorry! Of course I thank you for your leniency too, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>After chuckling at the amusing byplay she glanced at her own sister, who promptly approached to fulfill her role as her attendant.</p><p>“Shall I inquire for a room, milady?”</p><p>“Indeed, please make haste, it appears most dear to poor Angelica’s heart to settle the issue. And I am willing to indulge her request.”</p><p>Tuuliane gave a short bow of her head, before walking off to fulfill her new directives, so Rozemyne returned her attention back to the duo of sisters before her.</p><p>“I will send my dear Tuuliane your way, when the matter is settled. I do hope that this solution is to your satisfaction?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Indeed it is, you have my thanks, Lady Rozemyne”</p><p>After this surprising interaction she spent some more time looking at the lessons provided to them. She honestly did not expect much, but was the state of them truly this appalling in the last weave too? It was no wonder the average grades of Ehrenfest were pitiful or average at best. Did her reforms truly change this much? She could not remember the specifics anymore but surely it was better than… that.</p><p>She was taken out of her thoughts as she noticed her sister was approaching her again.</p><p>“Milady, there is a room available at the moment, shall I inform Angelica and Lieseleta?”</p><p>“Please do, I shall wait here for you to bring them to me, then we can go.”</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>She used the remaining time to further analyze the lessons given to them. After the others had joined her they made their way towards a small room, just a corridor away. Her big sister informed them that the very same room was held available for just such an occasion, making her cautious at once. But she held her tongue until all of them had entered before turning to Angelica, who was looking at her eagerly?</p><p>“Before we begin, let us reinforce Verbergen’s protection.”</p><p>It was lucky that she had instructed Tuuliane to take an area-wide sound blocking tool. After the tool was placed, and activated she turned her gaze at Angelica again.</p><p>“Now, what did you want to speak about, Angelica?”</p><p>“Ah, can we forsake Grammaratur for now, Lady Rozemyne? I was told it would make things easier.”</p><p>This was getting more and more ominous by the minute but she agreed nonetheless.</p><p>“Very well, so what is it you want from me?”</p><p>She was not prepared for Angelica to bend the knee before her, so looking at the older girl kneeling before her took her completely by surprise.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, It may appear sudden but please hear my plea. I speak from my heart, when I say I wish for nothing more than to serve as your sword and shield! Please grant me the honor to serve you as Angriff, allow me to become a knight under your service!”</p><p>“Um, Angelica you may not know this but that is not possible.”</p><p>She risked a concerned glance at Lieseleta, but the girl appeared unconcerned, if slightly anxious. Curious. She looked at Angelica fully again.</p><p>“I am an archnoble, knights may only serve our honored Archducal family, or a Giebe. I am sorry.”</p><p>She expected to see a look of sadness or devastation, but instead she saw only determination in Angelica’s eyes.</p><p>“I know that already, Lady Rozemyne. Which is why I decided on another way, which was shown to me by your father, Lord Guthfried himself.”</p><p>Angelica assumed a begging pose.</p><p>“Please give me the opportunity to swear my name to you, Lady Rozemyne. I long for nothing more than to enter your service. I am more than willing to create a namestone and present it to you, to show my absolute loyalty.” </p><p>“I- you want to wha?”</p><p>It was the first time she was truly baffled since her return to the past. She did not expect that. At all. Angelica was always a loyal knight. Her knight. But even then, she did not see the need to become her namesworn, like so many others, what had brought this about? Was it the fact she could not enter her service any other way? What was her motivation? She was so confused now.</p><p>“Do you even know what those words mean, Angelica? Are you aware of what you are asking?”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I swear to become your sword and shield, your personal knight. It is a knight’s duty to place their charge’s safety above all else, and follow them to the heights if they fail. Lord Guthfriend told me of the consequences, and the fact you may order me to do whatever you desire. Him and my own family informed me of the possible consequences in great detail until I understood. I do not mind them. Please allow me to present my name to you, my Lady.”</p><p>Maybe she should shock her a little, it was touching but she could not simply take a namestone lightly. She changed her expression into a stern frown, her sudden change of expression made everyone else tense.</p><p>“You would swear your name to me… knowing I could order you to do whatever I wish for?”</p><p>“Yes, my Lady. I do.”</p><p>“…and if I ordered you to kill your own family? Your sister Lieseleta, for example.”</p><p>Everyone looked at her in shock, at those cold words she spoke without the slightest trace of warmth in her voice. Lieseleta was switching between looking at her own sister and Rozemyne repeatedly, while clutching her hands together. Surprisingly it was Angelica who recovered first, tilting her head.</p><p>“I would protect you with my life from them, my Lady, but I don’t think they could harm you. They are attendants, not knights.”</p><p>Of course, leave it to Angelica to misunderstand even such a straightforward question. So she pushed further, letting her cold tone freeze every other occupant of the room.</p><p>“That was not my question, Angelica, so I will repeat myself. Can you kill your own family, If I demand it?”</p><p>“I do not think you would ever order me to do that, my Lady.”</p><p>“How would you know what I would or wouldn’t ask for? You have not known me nearly long enough. Do not further procrastinate, Angelica, answer the question.”</p><p>“But… I do know, my Lady. I know when there is danger nearby. I know when a feybeast will attack and when it will run. I know when I need to move to block and attack. And I know you would never order me to kill my family.”</p><p>Seeing Angelica not acknowledging the point she tried to make frustrated her more than she was willing to admit. She was aware she was beginning to leak some of her mana into the close vicinity, making everyone apart from the stupid girl before her tremble under its influence. But she did not care, it was time to get her point across!</p><p>“You are obviously too nai-”</p><p>“I know I don’t understand many things… I can see I trouble my sister a lot. But… In here… I feel it would hurt you even more than me, to give me that kind of order, my Lady.”</p><p>Her coldhearted mask broke into little pieces, her eyes widening as she saw Angelica tap her chest, just where her heart would be, softly. Angelica only looked at her, eyes full of resolve.</p><p>“I don’t understand what that means. But as we crossed blades I felt a connection-”</p><p>Angelica leaned slightly forward before continuing her sentence.</p><p>“My instincts tell me you are a kind-hearted person, Lady Rozemyne. I trust you with my life and my name. I am sure you would never willingly lead me astray. I know I am a failure as a noble and as a lady.”</p><p>Angelica took a deep breath after confessing her shortcomings to her.</p><p>“No other master would accept a failure such as me serving them. But you spar with me and excuse my language. I feel me and my family would both be safer with my name in your hands than any other future I could imagine.”</p><p>She lowered her head and crossed her hands before her in a perfect subordinate pose.</p><p>“So I beg you, my lady. Please allow me to swear my name to you.”</p><p>She… She did not expect that answer. How? How could Angelica know this?! Of course she would never order her to do it! But what gave Angelica the clue into it, did her mask fail? Was her performance in her new role lacking? She was aware she was spiraling into those questions but she could not help herself. Doubt was beginning to pull her into the abyss of her past, the countless mistakes… all of those deaths she could have prevented, would she have been stronger, better, a better noble.</p><p>She looked at her hands, those hands had caused the death of so many people, may it be direct or indirect. By the gods she had killed so many, and would kill so many more in the future. When would it end? Was it worth all of this suffering? What did she even try to accomplish with her actions anymore? Was she still worthy of finding happiness? After everything that happened? After she unlea-</p><p>“My Lady!”</p><p>She was pulled out of her thoughts by Angelica grabbing onto her hands, when had she moved to kneel directly before her? And why was she not bothered by her trembling fingers, or her flowing tears. When had she started to cry?</p><p>“This must be what my instincts tried to tell me.. I don’t have the right words to offer comfort. But I recognise the feeling.”</p><p>She looked directly into the sparkling eyes of the older girl, following her every word.</p><p>“It’s like when I have so many feelings and confusion under the surface… So I just smile. You smile like that too. But it feels wrong to smile sometimes. Please, don’t force yourself in front of those who are dedicated to you. You are brilliant, even when you don’t hide your pain with a smile. For that matter, please allow me to be the first to swear their loyalty to you. Please allow me to swear my name to you.”</p><p>“I- I am not worthy of your loy-”</p><p>“You are!”</p><p>She was slightly startled as Angelica strengthened her grip on her hands slightly, like giving her a lifeline to grab onto.</p><p>“You are more than worthy! You are so much stronger than me already, I can barely keep up with you in training. If anything I am not worthy to serve you. A defective sword like me would be no use to anyone, but in your brilliance you may even find some use for me. Please do not doubt your abilities! Allow me to become your very first pillar!”</p><p>Angelica let go of her hands, which were no longer trembling. The older girl assumed her previous stance, normally used in greetings.</p><p>“...Becoming my pillar, huh?”</p><p>She looked at the girl kneeling before her. Her knight, She may not have been the first, or the last, maybe not even the best of them. But just by crossing blades with her once, she was already like an open book to her most airheaded knight. Maybe there was more to her than she thought. Being lectured by Angelica of all people, how ironic.</p><p>“Very well, I will accept your loyalty, Angelica.”</p><p>The sheer joy in her face was nearly blinding to look at.</p><p>“Thank you, my Lady! I swear I will give my best not to disappoint you! Just point me, and I will obey!”</p><p>“So, when will you create your namestone? Do you need anything for its creation?”</p><p>“Ah, my family promised to help me in its creation. Please wait for it until I have finished my year at the Royal Academy. I will gather the required materials without fail!”</p><p>She chuckled at the sheer eagerness of the girl, before she could get ahead of herself she had just one more thing to do, as embarrassing as it was.</p><p>“I am glad to see you so motivated, but could I ask of you to cast washen unto myself? The whole conversation took an unexpected toll on me and my appearance.”</p><p>“My first order! Of course I can do that, my Lady! Please close your eyes, and hold your breath for a moment.”</p><p>After following the given directions she felt the telltale sign of water surrounding her until it vanished as fast as it appeared. She waited another moment before opening her eyes again, to witness Angelica was practically sparkling in delight. She chose to ignore her loyal knight for a moment and looked at the other occupants of the room, she had completely ignored them since the start of her near mental breakdown.</p><p>Her big sister was currently looking at her in open worry, while apparently having to hold herself back from moving to her side. Lieseleta was looking at her with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“I am sorry for saying what I did Lieseleta…”</p><p>“Do not be, Lady Rozemyne. It was a surprising, if understandable question, after I thought about it, while you were preoccupied with my older sister. I wonder though…”</p><p>She appeared unsure about something, how odd. She decided to voice her curiosity.</p><p>“Do you want to ask me something too, Lieseleta? Please do not tell me you also want to create a namestone, like your sister…”</p><p>The older girl chuckled before giving her answer.</p><p>“No nothing of the sort, Lady Rozemyne. But seeing what I did made me curious. Um, it may sound slightly odd to you, but seeing this side of my sister and you made me wonder. Can I- I mean would you mind- Ahh this is so awkward after all of this!”</p><p>She had never seen her steadfast retainer this dazzled. First Angelica now her steadfast pillar Lieseleta! What was happening?</p><p>“I- may I serve you too? Just as an attendant of course! I promise I will look out for my sister, so that she will not become too much of a burden to you, Lady Rozemyne.</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>“What? You know I am right!”</p><p>“You are! But there is no reason to say that before our new Lady!</p><p>“Hngh!”</p><p>She could not help but laugh aloud, this whole situation was just too hilarious to witness. Angelica triumphing over her sister in an argument. She took a few moments to regain her composure. When she looked up at the sudden silence she was horrified at the look in their eyes.</p><p>“You got such a beautiful laugh, my Lady. It is nearly as beautiful as your singing. No, it is as beautiful as when you summon Angriff to smite the foes who dare oppose your will!”</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>“What? You know I am right!”</p><p>“Stop trying to imitate what I say! Please forgive my sister, Lady Rozemyne. She is bereft of Grammaratur, as you already know.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>She gave both of them a blank look, causing them to wither somewhat, as they tried to regain their lost composure.</p><p>“Are both of you done?”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I am sorry, my Lady.”</p><p>“Good. Lieseleta, why do you suddenly want to enter my service? Did I not just probe your sister if she would kill you on my command?”</p><p>The green haired girl looked at her hands before she spoke.</p><p>“I was shocked, of course. But after witnessing the whole conversation, how could I not desire to serve you too?”</p><p>She looked at Angelica for a moment before looking at Rozemyne again, her expression exuding confidence in her decision.</p><p>“My older sister may have her own faults, but if she is willing to go to such lengths, just to be afforded the chance to serve you, I will trust her judgment.”</p><p>She gave her a sparkling smile before continuing.</p><p>“Your reaction to the words of my sister only confirmed her trust in your character. I would be honored If you would allow me the chance to become your attendant too, like Tuuliane, or Gretia.”</p><p>“I will speak about it with my parents, Lieseleta. I would be glad to have you among my retainers. But would your own parents not want you to serve the Archducal family? Like them?”</p><p>Lieseleta bowed her head slightly.</p><p>“I thank you for the opportunity, I will speak with my parents myself. Please do not worry about it. I will await Lord Guthried’s and Lady Roselinde’s decision in anticipation.”</p><p>“Very well, please understand I will require some time alone to gather myself, before returning to the playroom.”</p><p>“But of course, Lady Rozemyne. Come on, sister, let's return to the playroom ourselves.”</p><p>She watched as both sisters departed from the room before turning to her own older sister. She did not even finish her turn in her direction as she was taken into a fierce hug. She began to return the warm embrace, glad she had regained enough of her control to hold any further tears in.</p><p>“Please do not tell our parents about my near breakdown, sister.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Please, for me?”</p><p>“...I won’t but are you alright, my dear little sister?”</p><p>She squeezed a little bit stronger, melting more into the warm embrace.</p><p>“I am now, thank the gods I have the best big sister I could ever ask for.”</p><p>“I could not ask for a better little sister myself. Even if you make it so hard to not think of you as the big sister sometimes.”</p><p>“Thank you. I love you, big sister.”</p><p>“I love you too, little sister.”</p><p> </p><p>

    <h1>Gustav - Balancing on the edge</h1><p>Gustav slumped into his comfy chair inside of his office. How did it come to this? He had appeared so sure of himself in front of Benno earlier, only to be the only one suffering from the consequences of meeting that young apprentice shrine maiden Rozemyne. How, by the gods, did she even know about his adorable granddaughter anyway? He had made sure to move in the shadows as he checked for possible contractors to save Freida. Finding Lord Henrick was a stroke of luck he did not expect.</p><p>The negotiations were finished without any problems and he was overjoyed he could save his dear Freida without too great a cost. But apparently he was mistaken, Lady Rozemyne had just openly announced she was aware of his schemes and about to take over the contract, taking his granddaughter for herself. He had banked on the fact that she was just an abandoned child in the temple, without any form of extensive information network. Obviously he was completely mistaken, that level of information gathering was terrifying, she was even aware of Benno’s sister Corinna. Well to be fair she was registered as a co-owner of their business but still…</p><p>His hope to maybe escape the grasp of the small girl was completely shattered when he saw the terms of the new contract for Freida. It essentially made her a direct devouring subordinate, exactly what he had tried to avoid at any cost. He thanked the gods Lady Rozemyne was a young girl herself and no lord, maybe there was still hope his beloved granddaughter would be spared from becoming a mere breeding stock for the nobility. The thought of that happening alone made him nearly throw up, but he forced himself to smile as he had to watch helplessly as Freida signed herself into what was practically slavery. It maybe wasn’t worded that way but he was not willing to delude himself into thinking it wasn’t. He consoled himself with the fact that she would still stay with her family until her new master found a use for her, except being used as leverage to keep him and his family under control.</p><p>He opened the compartment inside of his desk containing some imported Vize. He needed a drink after all of this. He would need to speak with Freida and the rest of his family tomorrow, to make it clear to her what her new situation was. He took a big gulp of the liquid, trying to burrow his sorrow in the beverage. After finishing the whole bottle he decided to retire for the day. He was in no state currently to make coherent decisions.</p><p>After having breakfast he spoke with his family and made especially sure that Freida understood exactly what she was just forced to sign, she took it better than him at least, managing to hold in her tears. Her dream of opening a shop inside the noble quarter was now an impossibility. He just hoped for the best at this point, he would do what he could to not give Lady Rozemyne any reason to punish him through his granddaughter.</p><p>So far, she only demanded some simple things for him to acquire for her, even paying the demanded prices, so it was just normal business for now. But it was when he was summoned together with Benno and even Freida, that his dread grew to new highs. Apparently Lady Rozemyne had been reinstated into her family and would soon be baptized under her parents, making her a true archnoble. Which only increased her influence and the burden he would most likely face in the future. He was overjoyed as she presented the agreed upon magic tool, which would save his beloved granddaughter. Maybe his worries were unfounded and she was one of the few good nobles? Well, as close as they could ever get to being anything good at least. It seemed he was getting away without any major headaches this time as it was Benno who was burdened with an unreasonable order this time. </p><p>Those positive thoughts flew right out of the window as she looked at them all with a stern look, making all of them tense up. He was more than eager to please her, even volunteering his services to train some of her people. He was not even surprised when she offered another product to them, for a carpenter this time. After voicing his agreement, her next sentence made his blood freeze slightly. She wanted to involve his adorable granddaughter already? Poor Freida was right to look scared, most likely remembering their conversation about possible “duties” she would be expected to fulfill. He could not help himself to try to avert any attention from her, but Lady Rozemyne’s answer was not just freezing his blood, it was like chilling him to the bone.</p><p>She knew about Damien too! And she already had plans for the poor lad? Just how much did she know about his family? This was a direct threat to not only his own life but his whole family! She knew about them and would not hesitate to punish them, should he fail to serve her faithfully. Maybe his earlier attempt to avert her attention had doomed his grandson now too? She even made the same threat to Benno too, showing her knowledge about his closest staff. To further show her power over them she dismissed them right after.</p><p>After leaving the Thorwaechter estate inside of their carriage, he agreed with Benno on one thing. Lady Rozemyne was way, <em> way </em> too terrifying to disobey. Poor Freida was still slightly trembling in his lap.</p><p>“Sh- She knows Damian by name… What else does she know? Grandfather, what do we do now?”</p><p>He gave her a brief hug before replying.</p><p>“We can only serve her faithfully, you did see what happened when I tried to divert her attention from you.”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Her trembling got slightly worse, so he began to pet her head, the action beginning to calm her down. He swore to himself to never try to defy Lady Rozemyne again.</p><p>The next time he met her personally was when he introduced poor Ingo to her, as the best carpenter he could find for the specifications outlined to him. The chastisement made him flinch, but it seemed he had not failed in any major way. She let them go without any consequences, but he spoke to Ingo on their way back.</p><p>“Ingo, I thought you had experience in dealing with customers, which is why you refused to hear my advice previously.”</p><p>“Huh? But everything worked out fine, did it not? We got the job so what is the problem?”</p><p>He rubbed his temple at this answer, to alleviate his growing headache.</p><p>“You fool! Your carelessness nearly cost you your life!”</p><p>“What!? Did I do something wrong? What are you talking about, Guild Master?”</p><p>At the least he was looking at him with attention now, dear gods he should have tried to insist to speak about this earlier with him, he tried to calm his racing nerves.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne criticized your bearing after you left. We have to work on that, before she kills you for it, or worse.”</p><p>Ingo looked at him incredulously.</p><p>“She would kill me just for that?”</p><p>“Yes, she is an archnoble of the Veronica faction, and I am not just talking about killing you. Have you ever interacted with any nobles before? Why did you refuse my help? Do you even know what can happen should you displease, or worse, anger her?”</p><p>Ingo just looked at him in confusion. Oh dear, he could not help but sigh.</p><p>“Apparently not. Do you remember Kurt and what happened to him?”</p><p>“I just heard he got involved with some nobles and got killed for some failure or something, is that what you mean?”</p><p>He looked at the carpenter sternly.</p><p>“You did not hear the full story then. Kurt was involved with some noble, yes. To be more specific a mednoble from the Veronica faction. After failing to fulfill the order given to him he was killed by his noble patron-”</p><p>He made sure he looked into Ingo’s eyes before completing the story.</p><p>“Including his own family, everyone working at his store, and their families too. That can happen to you too, should you anger Lady Rozemyne too much.”</p><p>Ingo paled rapidly, his mouth hanging open.</p><p>“But I-”</p><p>“I do not care for any excuses, I will not risk you endangering us all anymore than you already did. So you will take some lessons, free of charge, to learn to deal with nobility. You cannot drop out of this now that she knows your name anyway. Do you understand me?”</p><p>To his great relief the foreman nodded his agreement quickly.</p><p>“Yes, Guild Master!”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>After that close encounter he thought he could predict Lady Rozemyne somewhat, but he was again surprised as he was summoned for a sudden meeting. After entering the room he became aware there were just Lady Rozemyne’s personal servants, the same ones that served her in the temple, and one new green haired girl present. None of her family that he could see. His stomach twisted in dread when the young green haired noble attendant of Lady Rozemyne activated the magic tool, which would silence their conversation, just after he had taken a seat. He tried to prepare for the worst, as the peaceful expression on Lady Rozemynes face made room for a carnivorous grin.</p><p>“I do not have much time, Gustav. So I will refrain from any formalities and speak bluntly.”</p><p>Not a good sign at all, she gestured for one of her servants to step up and she placed a collection of wooden boards before him, before stepping out of the tools range again. He looked at the boards nervously.</p><p>“Go read one of them, Gustav.”</p><p>He swallowed, before picking up one of the boards and began to read its contents. It was a list of names, some of them merchants he was not allied with, a few of them even rumored to have shady dealings. It looked like purchasing recipes for something, and a lot of purchases at that. It was not until he looked at the mark at the bottom that he froze in his seat. That crest was-</p><p>“It seems you recognize the marking at the bottom then, Gustav. That is indeed the crest of Wolf, the former guild master of the Ink Guild.”</p><p>He looked up at Lady Rozemyne, the dread in his stomach growing at seeing her cold eyes looking at him.</p><p>“It is a sad thing indeed that he had to ascend the towering stairway early, don't you think so too, Gustav?”</p><p>“But my Lady, Wolf just disappeared suddenly. Nobody knows what hap-”</p><p>He stopped himself as a truly evil smile bloomed on her face.</p><p>“Oh my, is that so?”</p><p>He looked at the boards, and at Lady Rozemyne again as the dots finally connected for him, making him shudder in fright. Did- did she just imply she had killed Wolf? This was obviously the content of his business ledger! And he had disappeared without a trace some time ago. He was replaced already but him being removed for some reason, even if he would not miss that rat, was still frightening to hear. From a young girl at that, even if she was a noble. He was taken out of his thoughts as Lady Rozemyne spoke up again.</p><p>“I may have misheard then, I just heard that his departure was most …painful… which is regrettable, of course. I do hope to never have to hear anything comparable again. Don’t you agree, Merchant Guild Master?”</p><p>That was as good as a confession! And those cold eyes, had she done it herself? He was most likely pale as a sheet of parchment, but the terror in front of him was still waiting for him to give her an answer.</p><p>“O- Of course, Lady Rozemyne! W- What do you request of me though? I will strive to accomplish whatever your desire may be!”</p><p>He was so glad she changed her terrifying expression back to her normal smile. Even if the speed of the transition was disturbing to watch.</p><p>“I am glad that you asked, Gustav.”</p><p>She glanced at the boards, containing the evidence of misdeeds.</p><p>“I want for you to use the information on those boards to remove those you deem unfit to further apply their trade. Replace them with whoever you see fit or destroy their business altogether, I do not care much for the details.”</p><p>She waved her hand in a motion displaying disinterest, the callus way she spoke of destroying someone’s livelihood made him feel slightly sick.</p><p>“What I do want is a cut of their business or any assets they possess, should they be unable to continue. I do have the means, so why not profit from it? Are you following me so far, Gustav?”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Rozemyne. I will do as you command, be assured.”</p><p>She nodded at him in apparent content, seemingly pleased at his fast answer.</p><p>“Very good. Take those boards with you, they are merely copies. Oh, and please do include Freida in this scheme of ours, it is about time for her to learn how to deal with enemies, I reckon.”</p><p>He did not dare to show any form of reluctance, he remembered what happened before after all. So he simply bowed his head and voiced his agreement.</p><p>“Of course, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“It seems Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace.”</p><p>After being dismissed he took the boards with him, not allowing anyone else to touch them, they were too valuable right now. As soon as he returned to his office he stored them in the small safe, hidden behind a painting. Afterwards he slumped into his chair again. He would need more Vize at this rate…</p><p> </p><h1>Gretia - A spark of hope?</h1><p>She knew her mother did not love her. She heard her say it herself so often after all. Mumblings of how much better her life had been before being burdened with birthing a child. Being burdened with her. Not like she would have been allowed to step up as her mother, even if she wanted to, as a former shrine maiden. That role fell to her uncle Wolfgang’s first wife, Gertrude. Hearing it for the first time hurt so much, but she was numb to that now too. She was constantly told by her whole 'family' not to embarrass or disgrace herself, as her mother had. Being told she was useless was normal to her, or only good for being given away for the highest possible price, like a tool. If only they would discard her now, instead of making her suffer this torment, without respite. Her brothers joined in on their ‘fun’ with her, calling her the temple girl and other such derogatory terms, mocking her hair color, among other things. But recently she grew even more scared of them than before, she did not like the change in their eyes. She did not know what it was but the fact they were beginning to…stare at her, with this strange… desire? It made her uncomfortable when it happened, even more than their usual cruelties.</p><p>The only constant in her life that didn’t cause her pain was her attendant Milly. She was only a commoner – not like her father would ever pay for a noble attendant for her – but she was the only one in this horrible house that treated her like a person behind closed doors. It made her feel slightly ashamed that she further burdened her when it got too much and she cried on a few occasions while she bathed or brushed her hair. Her 'father' simply picked one of the commoner servants to attend to her in the mornings and evenings when her workload allowed – without easing any of her burdens at all. When she heard the decision, she braced herself for figuring out how to dress herself, only for Milly to show up every time and silently prepare her. They both knew if anyone heard a commoner servant speaking kindly to her, Milly would never be seen again… So she took comfort in the silence, and hoped it would go unnoticed.</p><p>She was so glad she did not fail her debut, she did not even want to imagine what they would do to her, should she fail. She looked on absentmindedly as the other children after her played their songs. She was pulled out of her usual numbness as the last one in the line climbed the stage, looking at the girl who had just taken her place, preparing herself to play her song gave her a strange sense of…longing? She could not explain those feelings. The girl was beautiful for sure. But why was she evoking those feelings in her? As she continued to watch it was finally time for the last performance of the day, maybe she could get some moments of peace then? But as the midnight-haired girl began to sing…</p><p>Words were not enough to describe it, it was so very beautiful. As if the bell-like voice removed all of her fears and troubles, making her float on a cloud of happiness. It was over much too soon. As she regained awareness of her surroundings again she noticed she had fallen to her knees! And touching her face she was even openly crying! Oh no, her 'family' would never forgive her! Her panic subsided slightly as she looked around, nobody was paying any form of attention to her, everyone just… stared at the girl who had just sung that beautiful melody. She stood up before subtly using the inside of her sleeves to remove any traces of her tears. </p><p>The ensuing chaos after the song assured she could slip by unnoticed, and her 'family' never chastised her for anything, so she got away scot free. She thanked the gods for small mercies. Inside of the playroom she used her skills to blend into the background to collect information about the girl. It was no challenge at all, her name was spreading like wildfire. Apparently she was called Rozemyne, an archnoble and the heir of house Thorwaechter. She was also a really talented future knight? At least that was all the information she could gather before the target of her curiosity entered the playroom herself. Being joined shortly thereafter by a green haired laynoble girl, who took a subordinate position. So Lady Rozemyne already had an attendant? Her heart sank slightly at the sight, so much for that opportunity. She silently watched as Lady Rozemyne began to mingle with the others, greeting everyone inside of the Veronica faction, excluding herself of course. She was still watching as Lady Rozemyne finished her round and began to look around, before looking directly into her eyes!</p><p>She averted her head hastily, hoping her staring had not attracted attention, but the gods had used up their mercy after saving her from the consequences of yesterday’s blunder. By the seven, Lady Rozemyne was walking directly at her! What should she do? It was obviously too late to escape so she tried to steel her nerves and gave her a shaky greeting upon her arrival. She was scared at first but Lady Rozemyne appeared so kind to her. She did not demean her in any way, even as she slipped in her speech slightly after revealing her ambitions to become an attendant. She even offered her the chance to become her apprentice attendant!</p><p>She was hesitant at first but what Lady Rozemyne said next made the seeds of hope bloom inside of her chest.</p><p>“Seeing that you would not have any experience it would be expected of you to live in my family’s estate for some time, to learn under my current head attendant, Mathilde. I do hope that is agreeable for you?”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>She could not suppress her exclamation, it was like a dream came true! Maybe she could escape from her 'family'? At least for some time? She hastily agreed to the sudden proposal, even if Lady Rozemyne was a more cruel master than she portrayed herself as in public, it could not possibly be worse than her current treatment. Now she only had to get the agreement of her tormentors. Being an attendant brought with it a salary, so maybe she could appeal to their greed? It was worth a try at least.</p><p>“Uhm, Father? Pardon me, I have something to discuss.”</p><p>She knew her best chance was during dinner, in front of the attendants. Even her 'family' put in some modicum of effort to keep up appearances in front of the outside world. So she spoke up timidly when her father got started on his alcohol, and did her best to hold her noble mask as her 'father' threw her a seething look for daring to talk.</p><p>“Well? What is it?”</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, the daughter of Lord Guthfried, extended an offer of employment towards me. She wishes for me to become her attendant. I would be happy to take on this responsibility and begin repaying the consideration you have shown me from the blessings Greifechan would bestow upon me. …If it would please you…”</p><p>Her voice grew small towards the end as the frown on her “father’s” face continued to deepen.</p><p>“Attendant to an archnoble, huh? Let me think…”</p><p>She was surprised that her 'family' showed reluctance at the offer, was bringing money to them not enough? Her 'father' began to mutter under his breath, with his elbows on the table, one hand supporting his head while the other swirling the vize in his goblet. She could barely understand his words by straining her ears, he wasn’t even pretending that she was still part of the conversation.</p><p>“She would make 5 large silvers at least, maybe a small gold at most… Not bad for that waste of space… Argh but she would still wear my name, any of her mistakes would be a disgrace to my house! And who knows what company that temple flower keeps… She’ll be hard to sell once she’s used, otherwise I’d…”</p><p>She was shocked when she heard the mumblings of her 'father'. For so long she let herself believe that maybe if she could bring some boon to them, they would treat her somewhat better. She never imagined they would start to like her, but she thought they might at least treat her as human. To hear him worry that she would become damaged goods, when she already proposed to give him her earnings… She was almost grateful for her 'mother' for interrupting her 'father' by joining them for dinner when she did – late as always, expecting that she would “know her place”, eat quickly and leave. Her mother gave her a brief disgusted look for still being at the table, before turning her attention to her 'father'.</p><p>“Oh my, dear husband. What is weighing on your mind? Did a foul sight spoil your appetite as well?”</p><p>Even without her 'mother' looking her way, she could feel the mocking smile in her tone. Did all her family delight in her torment so much?</p><p>“You will never believe what that useless girl just told me.”</p><p>“Oh? Do go on.”</p><p>“She wants to be the attendant of that Thorwaechter temple girl.”</p><p>She had to suppress a shudder at hearing her father speak of Lady Rozemyne, an archnoble of their own faction, in such disrespectful manner. Did he truly despise the temple so much that he would place them all at risk of offending an archnoble branch house?</p><p>“The temple girl serving another temple girl. How touching.”</p><p>She sounded disgusted. </p><p>“She could be paid some acceptable money, but…” </p><p>She was hanging on her father’s words with hope, maybe he was coming around to the idea of her making some money for the house? He sounded unsure, but it was a start. Her 'mother' looked at her 'father' with pleading eyes as she rebuked him.</p><p>“What about that acquaintance of yours that was interested in buying her as a servant? Surely that would benefit us more, I doubt that child could afford to pay as much. And heavens, what if she gets spoiled while she is away, and he doesn’t want to buy her anymore?! Must I be kept from a life without this disgrace of a daughter for even longer? Haven’t I suffered enough?”</p><p>She had to fight her own will to not interrupt or run to her room to hide away from the revolting scene of her father consoling her mother. They would rather sell her off as a servant to make more money, and wouldn’t even let her work in case it would detract from her value as a commodity?!</p><p>Her mother eventually calmed with her father’s consoling, and her face turned contemplative.</p><p>“It will be hard to turn down an archnoble, especially one related to Lady Veronica… Perhaps we can make the girl lose interest, somehow?”</p><p>“If we use her young age and lack of experience to our advantage, Greifechan might smile upon us too.”</p><p>Her father finally looked satisfied and turned back to her. She did her best to hide her nausea, waiting for his words that would determine her future.</p><p>“Gretia, I want you to tell Lady Rozemyne that I am open to negotiations, if she is willing to pay more than a simple salary for you. Say, a purchase price.. no, let’s call it something of a dowry… Two large golds will do. You can leave now.”</p><p>The sheer level of greed left her slightly stunned, but she merely nodded at him, to show her obedience, and left.</p><p>She managed to get into her room before falling to her knees in despair, her dream of sweet freedom shattered into tiny, little pieces. She had to suppress the sobs, it would be even worse if she was caught crying, so she used her own arms to hug herself. She began to lean her back at the wall of her room, pulling her knees to her body, assuming a fetal position. The action helped her somewhat to center herself.</p><p>If those were the conditions for her freedom, then she would never be free. Who would be willing to pay a small fortune for the opportunity for her to work for them in addition to a salary? The mere thought was madness. She was beginning to have trouble breathing, the tears flowing freely now, at least her short breath meant she would not be heard. She could not stop her shaking as she lost any power over her body, falling to the side on the cold floor of her room. She would never be free, she was just a tool, free to be sold to the highest bidder, like cattle.</p><p>Her parents did not love her, mother was ignoring her at best and openly lamenting her birth at worst. Her brothers were openly tormenting her, and she did not even want to think about what future actions they would take to sate their desire for “fun” with her. What was even the reason for her existence? Was it to suffer? Were the gods that cruel? Maybe they found it entertaining? She chuckled slightly to herself. Yes maybe that was it, everything would be so much easier if she simply stopped to hope for some form of salvation, this sweet numbness was beginning to take hold of her, but before she could succumb to its temptations she remembered the song she heard Lady Rozemyne sing previously.</p><p>It was like being slapped awake from a nightmare, remembering her beautiful voice, the harmony of the song, the feeling it evoked in her. To feel hope. Her radiant smile as she spoke to her, expressing her desire for her to enter her service…</p><p>No, she could not lose hope yet, there was still a chance, maybe she could convince Lady Rozemyne to become her creditor of sorts? Reducing her salary after her graduation to pay her back in small installments? It was worth asking at least, she had nothing to lose at this point.</p><p>The small spark of hope in her chest lit up once more.</p><p>Yes, she could despair if she was rejected. She had to cling on to this spark, however faint it was. It was the only thing that kept her going now. She had to speak to Lady Rozemyne, and ask or even beg if necessary. What was her dignity in exchange for freedom? Nothing. She did not even have much to begin with.</p><p>Just after she had recovered from nearly allowing the numbness to claim her, Milly entered her room. It looked like she was going to say something for a moment, but just offered a hand to help her get up in the end. As she stood, she swore she felt a quick squeeze as Milly’s hand lingered holding hers a moment longer than necessary. She looked at her attendant with surprise for a moment, but she just smiled at her and squeezed her hand again. It made her feel guilty to shed even more tears, but feeling those kind hands, the warmth of another person when her heart felt so cold, was just so comforting. Perhaps this was something akin to how a mother would act.</p><p>The next time she saw Lady Rozemyne in the playroom she was about to approach her, until she saw that she was leaving the room with those sisters she spoke to a few times. It was maddening how her possible salvation was eluding her even now. Luckily she returned after some time, but she hesitated as she saw that Lady Rozemyne looked slightly tired, so she refrained for now. She would ask her tomorrow, hopefully she would be in a better mood then.</p><p>She had more luck the following day. Lady Rozemyne was socializing as normal, so she began to approach her cautiously. But she proved she had excellent senses again, as she turned in her direction when she was still a few paces away.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne praises be to Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, who has answered my prayers and woven the threads of our fates together once again. Could I mayhaps ask for an opportunity to talk more leisurely? If possible under Verbergen’s protection?”</p><p>She waited in tense agitation for Lady Rozemynes answer, who was looking at her with the same smile as she had previously. She just hoped it would remain that way.</p><p>“It warms my heart to see you again Gretia, Dregarnuhr is spinning our threads most beautifully, granting them the chance to overlap once again.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne sent a glance at the green haired girl, serving as her attendant, who promptly nodded and made her way to one of the adult supervisors of the playroom. If she remembered correctly her name was Tuuliane.</p><p>“Until Tuuliane returns, tell me Gretia. Are you well? We did not have much opportunity to speak after our last meeting. Dregarnuhr spun my thread quite eagerly to intersect elsewhere.”</p><p>“I am well, Lady Rozemyne. There is nothing for you to worry about.”</p><p>Her beautiful golden eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>“I see, let us revisit the topic under Verbergen’s protection then.”</p><p>Apparently she was easy to read for her. She gave her best to hide any unease but it was for naught. Still she would not backtrack now, so short before her goal. She did not have to wait for long as Tuuliane returned and the three of them made their way to one of the adjacent rooms. After entering it she was looking on curiously as Tuuliane began to place a areawide sound-silencing tool, before activating it and retaking her usual position at her mistresses side. It was time.</p><p>“Now Gretia, let us forsake Grammaratur’s dance for a moment. Tell me what worries you so much.”</p><p>“I- I spoke with my parents about your gracious offer to me. Becoming your apprentice attendant, and they agreed-”</p><p>She hesitated slightly, the fear of being rejected gnawing at her confidence. Lady Rozemyne simply continued to look at her patiently.</p><p>“They agreed to it but- but, there are um, there are conditions they want fulfilled beforehand.”</p><p>She looked at her hands nervously, fearing for her reaction.</p><p>“I see, so Gretia, tell me of those conditions please.”</p><p>She could not hide the slight tremor in her voice as she laid her “family's” demands bare.</p><p>“T- They want to inquire if- if you are willing to pay some sort of um. Some sort of dowry? In addition to the usual wages I would receive.”</p><p>“...So your parents want to sell you to me? Did I get that right, Gretia?</p><p>She was panicking slightly at the apparent disgust on Lady Rozemynes face, so she got onto her knees, and gave her best begging pose.</p><p>“Please at least consider it, Lady Rozemyne! I am more than willing to pay you back after I graduated. Or maybe I- I could create a namestone and present it to you? Please just think about it!”</p><p>“...Wait. So you <em> want </em> me to buy you? Like some sort of object?”</p><p>She nodded fervently at her possibly Lady.</p><p>“Yes! If possible, or at least loan me the money, I promise I will pay you back, I will serve you faithfully, with all my heart. Just grant me the chance to prove it!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>She was glad Lady Rozemyne just looked at her in confusion, not revulsion. It meant there was a chance she was still considering it, so she continued to press on.</p><p>“I beg of you, Lady Rozemyne. Please buy me from my family, I will serve you well.”</p><p>“...I do confess I have never been told that before. Um, are you sure Gretia? I mean I could be worse than whatever your family is doing to you to trigger that sort of reaction.”</p><p>“I don’t care, please buy me, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>Her sudden fervor was even surprising herself. But it was too late to pull back now, her salvation was so close! Lady Rozemyne began to massage her temple in sheer bewilderment. That was not a rejection, right?</p><p>“How much are they even asking from me to buy you, Gretia?”</p><p>“Two large Gold, my Lady.”</p><p>“So little?!”</p><p>She was taken aback at Lady Rozemyne’s outburst, did she just say two large gold was little? As far as she was aware that was a huge sum of money! The difference of wealth between mednobles and archnobles was even bigger than she would have guessed…</p><p>“They are willing to sell their own daughter for a mere two large gold? This is ridiculous!”</p><p>“Milady, please calm yourself.”</p><p>She was somewhat thankful for Tuuliane’s intervention. As happy as it made her that Lady Rozemyne thought she was worth more than the demanded sum, there was still the issue that she had not agreed to buy her yet!</p><p>“So you are willing to buy me, my Lady? Please, nothing would make me happier.”</p><p>“I don't even know what to say to such a statement.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne was shaking her head in exasperation now, was that a rejection?</p><p>“So is that a-"</p><p>“Sure, whatever. I don’t care anymore.”</p><p>She froze in place, this was an obvious rejection, wasn’t it?</p><p>“Um, so you will not pay-”</p><p>“Oh no I will pay for you, Gretia.”</p><p>Her heart soared in happiness, she could no longer suppress her tears, letting them flow freely as she threw herself at her new Lady’s feet in gratitude.</p><p>“Thank you! Thank you, my Lady! I swear you will not regret it!”</p><p>“Argh Gretia, calm down! There’s no need for you to demean yourself like this! Look at your dress too, it’ll get dirty, come now, get up please.”</p><p>Those words of care made her just sob even harder, she had never before heard similar words spoken with even a trace of the warmth of her new Lady. It made her feel all warm and fuzzy, hearing someone so openly worrying over her. It was the best she had ever felt in her whole life!?</p><p>“Ahh, Tuuliane, call Angelica and Lieseleta. I need her to cast waschen on Gretia and help me calm her down somewhat!”</p><p>“At once, Milady.”</p><p>She felt so warm with all the care Lady Rozemyne was showing for her, she could not stop smiling, what did it matter if she sullied her dress? She was nearly free. Free!</p><p>She was still basking in her newfound happiness as she was pulled to her feet by some older blue haired girl, and some other girl with green hair was fussing about her appearance. She was faintly aware it was the sister duo her new Lady talked with previously. She only calmed down after she was slapped in the face by the older girl!</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>“What? It worked, see?”</p><p>“That is no excuse to hit someone!”</p><p>“Still worked though…”</p><p>After being pulled out of her delirium of happiness she did her best to regain her composure. It was so hard not to smile right now.</p><p>“May Heilschmerz blessing be granted to Gretia. Angelica casts waschen on her and lets leave this room. At this rate I fear what else I will hear inside of it.”</p><p>“As you command, my Lady!”</p><p>She had only moments to react before she was enclosed in water, luckily it disappeared as fast as it appeared. She was still coughing to regain her breath.</p><p>“Warn someone before you cast waschen on them, sister!”</p><p>“Sorry, I forgot.”</p><p>Looking at the sister duo was amusing, if only she would not have been deprived of air she would be laughing at the sight, but she decided to ignore it in favor of getting air back into her lungs. Her new Lady was looking at her in open worry now.</p><p>“Are you sure you are alright now, Gretia?”</p><p>“Yes thank you my Lady, I have never felt better!”</p><p>“Ah so you serve our Lady now too? Welcome!”</p><p>She was slightly confused at the older girl's exclamation, was she not a knight in training?</p><p>“Um, do excuse me but are you not aspiring to become a knight? What do you mean you serve Lady Rozemyne too?”</p><p>“Oh do not mind that, I have promised to give her my name, so I will serve her soon!”</p><p>She looked at the older girl before nodding at her. It was a completely understandable reply. Who would not want to serve such a gracious master as Lady Rozemyne?</p><p>“I completely understand. Maybe I will do the same in the future.”</p><p>“...Great, another one.”</p><p>She decided to ignore the older girl’s sisters grumbling and they all returned to the playroom. Where she learned their names were Angelica for the older, and Lieseleta for the younger sister. She needed to remember them. As all of them would serve her savior soon.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne agreed to meet her “parents” in three days'. and as she returned home she told them of the fortunate news, doing her best to hide her happiness. They were slightly shocked at first but it was the first time she received any form of praise from them. She decided to ignore it, she would be free from them soon.</p><p> </p><h1>Mathilde - Becoming Wiegenmilch once more</h1><p>Mathilde had been one of the few attendants that followed Lady Roselinde when she married Lord Guthfried. Theirs was a rare love match where Bluanfah had danced for so long. The day of their starbind was the happiest either of them had been and Mathilde was also glad to see her charge happy. But during the decade that followed their marriage she saw her lady go through so many of Glucklitat’s trials. Ostracization in ladies’ society, that poisonous water goddess Vivianne, and losing both of her children one after the other due to mana capacity just to name a few. Seeing her charge endure so much while Greifchan withheld her bounty that should have been theirs after all the trials Glucklitat set for them hurt Mathilde nearly as much as it did them.</p><p>She had to watch helplessly as Roselinde spent her days in a semi awake state, only coming alive for the few times she could visit little Tuuliane, over the years. That was until that one fateful day when she received a letter from the High Bishop of the temple. The contents of that letter gave all of them hope, her Lady blooming to life in excitement. It touched her heart to see her like that, if what was written in there was true, her lady could finally become Wiegenmilch just like she always longed for.</p><p>When she laid her eyes on young Rozemyne for the first time, after receiving the order to pick her up from the temple, she was instantly charmed. The adorable little girl held herself with so much grace that one was hard pressed to believe she had been raised in that awful temple! The little dear said her greetings perfectly and looked so adorable whilst doing it too. </p><p>‘Ahh, the bliss of seeing young children doing their best! She reminds me of the times my granddaughters were her age, I do miss those moments.’</p><p>On the carriage ride to the estate she could recognize the signs of anxiety in Rozemyne’s bearing, though she did a wonderful job trying to hide it. Her eyes not focusing on the same thing for more than a few moments gave her away. She seemed to share that little quirk with her mother, it was adorable to watch! Just imagining a young Roselinde beside her doing the same thing was almost enough to make her break into a shameless grin.</p><p>When they reached the estate she led the still anxious Rozemyne to the meeting room that had already been prepared beforehand. When the customary greetings were done, she noticed Roselinde was trying hard to hold herself back from running at the little darling, like Lord Guthfried would, by putting her hand into her feystone pouch. She was nearly tempted to do the same, but propriety and her station demanded she stay where she was.</p><p>The exchange that followed left her and her fellow co-workers very surprised. It started with the usual pleasantries and talks about nothing important, but after the tea was changed, it was like a switch had been flipped for little Rozemyne. She almost brought her mother to tears with her cold rebuttals to her questions. Mathilde understood that it was natural that the girl would harbor some form of resentment at seemingly being discarded to that foul temple. That was probably where she learned to be so cautious. Still, seeing her be so suspicious of her own mother’s intentions was still heartbreaking to watch.</p><p>After a while, Roselinde hurried their talks and dragged the girl into her hidden room. Partially to check young Rozemyne’s mana capacity, and partially so she could hide the tears that were forming in her eyes from others. Just when she was starting to grow concerned, Roselinde called for her via the communication device and told her to bring some tea and a… blanket?</p><p>‘What is happening inside that hidden room?’</p><p>She collected the items and asked for permission to enter. The sight she saw when she got inside was the picture of cuteness. Little Rozemyne was napping on her mother’s chest all curled up like a tiny shumil! And Roselinde was nearly glowing in happiness while cooing and humming lovingly at her daughter. </p><p>‘!!!’</p><p>She was hard pressed to hold in her squeal of delight. The sight was just too adorable! It was as if Kunstzeal herself had come down from the heavens to paint adorableness itself! After taking a moment to gather herself, and dusting more than one feystone inside of her own pouch, she served Roselinde some tea and covered the little shumil and mother pair with the requested blanket. She raised an eyebrow at Roselinde, partially to tease her about the content smile on her face and partially to ask about the results of the test. She didn’t need to ask, of course, the glow on her face was already answer enough, but teasing her charge was something she was not willing to give up on even in the face of such cuteness.</p><p>Roselinde answered with a smile and a gentle nod. Which meant the adorable little napping shumil will be becoming the newest member of the household! Roselinde took the moment to whisper something to her.</p><p>“Mathilde, since Rozemyne will soon be returning to noble society as my daughter, I want you to become her future head attendant.”</p><p>“It would be my pleasure to serve her, my Lady.”</p><p>With that, Mathilde left the hidden room with a smile broader than was strictly appropriate, drawing the curiosity of the others outside. She decided to sate their curiosity.</p><p>“Lady Roselinde and her daughter will be staying in the hidden room for a little bit longer.”</p><p>Her indirect confirmation that young Rozemyne was accepted back into the household was met with a warm reception. Apparently she was not the only one already charmed by the adorable girl.</p><p>Rozemyne was like Flutrane who washes away stagnant snow with her flowing waters to the Thorwaechter house. She managed to calm down that old trombe’s hatred towards their family by <em> gifting </em> her hair cleansing product to Veronica at her own baptism. Later she proposed a way to get young Tuuliane to spend more time with her birth family by having her become an apprentice attendant in her service. The joy on Roselinde’s face after their talks behind Verbergen’s veil was just as bright as the one she had during her starbinding.</p><p>When she began her new service as young Rozemyne’s new head attendant she was shocked by the girl’s blessings of Mestionora and Kunstzeal. It took her no time at all to blow through all of her theoretical lessons with little signs of trouble, she even began to start researching the coursework of the Royal Academy! And as if that was not enough she demanded to look at every course available to her, and finished them with aplomb too! It was part awe-inducing, part terrifying to see such genius at work. Surely she would make for an excellent scholar in her future.</p><p>By the gods she still remembered the first time she bore witness to her young Lady’s harspiel lessons. She was aware that Rozemyne cherished her old temple attendants, and Rosina was certainly proving her worthiness of the favor granted to them. But as her Lady began to sing…</p><p>It was like entering the realm of Schlaftraum while being accompanied by the sweet melodies only Kunstzeal herself could invoke. She lost track of everything else until the song was finished. After coming to her senses she saw that only Rosina and Delia were apparently unaffected by her Lady’s divine singing voice. Most likely through regular exposure. She was ashamed to admit that she was not able to develop the same immunity as the lessons continued, or the relief she felt to not be the only one affected. Roselinde and Lord Guthfried and even Tuuliane were similarly taken in by her singing, and she regretted not being able to wave her schtappe in a similar fashion. It was the first time in years she cursed her demanded propriety.</p><p>As she bore witness to the lessons in etiquette, taught by Roselinde in private tea parties, she was again shocked at young Rozemyne’s genius. She held herself with a level of poise and dignity that was nearly unnatural for a girl at her age. What had happened inside of that blasted temple to cause such a finely crafted image? She shuddered at the mere thought. Apparently she was not the only one worried as Roselinde confided in her that the very same worries plagued her too. Rozemyne was just too skilled at projecting what being a noble Lady meant. It was unsettling to witness such a level of perfection in a young girl, just about to enter her summer.</p><p>Rozemyne was skilled enough to <em> lead </em> any form of conversation she was part of. By the seven, she was leading the conversations with her own mother that were meant to <em> teach her </em> about the matter just after the third lesson! She expected some skill at it as she saw how she dealt with those merchants, but this level of emotional and facial control… It was as fascinating to watch as it was hard to comprehend at times.</p><p>After her Baptism proper, her new Lady had decided to choose the path of a knight like her father rather than the one of an attendant like her mother, or even as a scholar. While she could most definitely take on multiple courses at the academy, everyone knew what happened to talented individuals in this gods-forsaken duchy, ruled by Chaocipher. It was an understandable choice, as being an arch-attendant or arch-scholar she would most likely be employed by the Archducal family. At least as a knight she could remain in the knight order while serving no one individually.</p><p>After her first day at the knight’s training grounds it became apparent that Mestionora and Kunstzeal were not the only ones who had blessed her lady. She was also a genius at enhancement magic! Lord Bonifatius even took her in as his disciple on the spot! Her lady also seemed to enjoy the training with all her heart. She managed to master the sword, spear and halberd as if using them was second nature to her. For all the gods that favored her, Schlagziel, the god of hunting, didn’t seem to grace her abilities with a bow. She always managed to miss the targets that were set up for her as if the goddess of wind herself guided her arrows astray, much to her apparent frustration.</p><p>Still, seeing her young mistress’s pouting face, with those blown up cheeks was just too adorable to witness! It was such a rare sight to see she cherished every moment she was allowed to witness – much to the envy of Roselinde when she told her about it. She had apparently completely forgotten that she carried a similar expression in her own youth, seeing those parallels was just too adorable to watch!</p><p>It almost felt like these happy times would never end, but apparently that old Trombe of Ehrenfest had different plans. As if making Roselinde’s life a living hell before was not enough for her, she decided to dig her ugly claws into little Rozemyne right after her winter debut. She asked her to serve the Archducal Family as a retainer, the one thing they had been trying to avoid with her choice of academy course! And a boy at that!? What sort of male archduke candidate gets a pre-academy girl knight assigned to him!? It was utter absurdity no matter how you looked at it.</p><p>Rozemyne didn’t let it show on her face but it was clear to Mathilde that she was very upset by how the circumstances unfolded. Anyone else in her place would feel the same way, she did not even try to stop her silently fuming master as she saw her leave the premises, she could already see that a few trees would suffer a most unfortunate end today. </p><p>But she was not prepared for her young mistress to return with a new pet zantze. She was slightly anxious about the usually very violent and ferocious feybeast at first but the adorable feline was following Rozemyne's orders without any problems, and seeing the now freshly named Hisui rub her head against Tuuliane’s legs was simply adorable. She later found her young charge spooning her new pet in her bed as she slept, the mere sight was devastating to witness. She dusted several feystones at the adorable image alone! After telling Roselinde about it she immediately hurried to her daughters chambers to see it for herself faster than Steifebriese. Seeing her nearly unable to suppress a delighted squee at the sight as she dusted her own feystones too was balm for her aching heart.</p><p>Regarding Rozemyne’s new employment by the Archducal family, it was obvious to her that her young charge disliked the task that was thrust upon her very much. But she tackled it head on like she did everything else. According to her first impression of her new master he was… just as the degrading rumors painted him to be. Uneducated, brash and self assured to a near painful degree. She despaired slightly as she had to watch helplessly as another member of the family was abused by their duchy, with no chance to escape. After her first day of tutoring her charge however came to her with a very strange request. </p><p>“Mathilde… would you be opposed to adopting someone?”</p><p>She was slightly confused by the strange request, so she tried to understand her young Lady’s question.</p><p>“What do you mean milady?”<br /><br />“Well you see, there is a girl I met in the playroom who I wanted to be my attendant but apparently her family wants to sell her for profit rather than let her work. And I would rather have her out of such a horrible situation. While I can just pay her family the asked amount, I fear that if they are still related they might harass her later, so I was planning on having her be adopted by someone I trust and know will treat her well.”</p><p>She paused a moment to think, as much as it touched her that her Lady thought so highly of her was she truly willing to become Wiegenmilch once more?</p><p>“My Lady, I will need more details before I answer. Would you be willing to answer some of my questions about the girl?”</p><p>“Of course, tell me those questions Mathilde. I will do my best to answer them.”</p><p>With agreement secured she started to begin her questioning.</p><p>“Well my first question would be the name of the poor dear, and how old she is next.”</p><p>“My, In my eagerness I nearly forgot to mention it. Let me give you a brief summary. Her name is Gretia and she is the same age as me. She is a mednoble who has gray hair and bluish green eyes. I met her in the playroom on the first day, and after talking with her for a bit she left a good impression on me. I noticed Gretia was really shy or even timid, and her reaction when I told her she had to live in one of the rooms for some time until she learned to better attend me was… startling. She looked so happy for the opportunity to leave her family it was worrying. And today we spoke again and she told me of her family’s agreement for her to enter my service, but apparently there are terms and they are frankly just revolting to me.”</p><p>She needed a moment to unpack everything she heard. Aside from the girl’s appearance, everything she just heard sounded alarming. A young girl being happy to be away from her family? And even more disturbing was the fact that her own family dared to make demands from someone of superior rank. Even when Rozemyne was still a young sprout, just entering her summerdays, for a mere mednoble to make demands of an archnoble to enter their service…</p><p>“They demanded something from you Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>The expression that bloomed on her Lady’s face made even her stand a little bit straighter, she was reminded that Rozemyne was fairly advanced for her age.</p><p>“Indeed they did, how daring of them. Can you believe they <em> demanded </em> I pay them two large gold to <em> allow </em> Gretia to enter my service? I would be impressed by the sheer bravery, if I were not so disgusted that they intend to sell their daughter to me like mere cattle. I think they need to be reminded of their place, and helping an innocent girl by giving her a loving family would only be the right thing to do, don’t you agree Mathilde?”</p><p>She nodded her agreement carefully, Rozemyne’s bearing was slightly overwhelming to witness. She was not even the target of the girl’s anger, but just standing before her charge right now was as if she was looking at a very angry Lord Guthfried, combined with the angelic smile of her mother. It was truly a terrifying combination to witness, she would pity those fools who caught her Lady’s attention if they would not have sinned against Wiegenmilch.</p><p>“Of course, my Lady. I would be glad to adopt the poor dear, as I will be training young Gretia to become worthy of serving you it would be no trouble to become her Wiegenmilch in addition of Erwachlehren.”</p><p>“Most excellent.”</p><p>The sheer malice in those two words nearly caused her to shiver slightly, those poor fools did not know who they angered. Dregarnuhr continued her weaving with exceptional speed as it was time to meet her new daughter's old family. Their affronts to her lady began even before the meeting, as they dared to request her to meet them at their estate. Such unacceptable behavior for a mednoble family to request an archnoble to travel to them, and yet there they stood in the modest entryway after a short carriage ride in the noble district. They were greeted by servants to take their cloaks and accompany them through the mansion, not even by the hosts as it would be proper. From the corner of her eyes, she noticed her little lady giving one of the servant girls, who was standing in front of her with her head deeply bowed, a sweet smile. </p><p>“What was your name?”</p><p>“It’s Milly, my lady. I apologize if I offended you.”</p><p>“Not at all, in fact I am quite pleased with you. Would you be so kind and lead us to our hosts?”</p><p>“At once.”</p><p>It was an odd interaction, she definitely felt like she missed something important, especially as the energy of her charge changed drastically as they walked through corridors. She gave off a sense of danger now… But the thoughts immediately left her mind as they entered the tastelessly decorated tea room and she laid eyes upon the family that demanded their presence. The lord and lady of the house were already seated at the table when they entered! At least they rose to greet their guest, but there was only one person in the room who was awaiting their arrival kneeling. As she looked at the girl who would become her daughter she could not help but notice the slightly apprehensive looks she was giving her current family, it only hardened her own resolve to remove the girl from these thralls of Chaocipher masquerading as Wiegenmilch.</p><p>Her lady stood across from the table with the perfect noble pose and a pleasant smile as she waited for Lord Wolfgang to lead his family in first time greetings. The man returned a noble smile, however did not move to take a knee, and continued to stare at Lady Rozemyne intensely. Even she could sense the building anger, standing just off to the side of her lady, but the man clearly had no self preservation instincts. Just how foolish can a mednoble be to expect an archnoble to greet him?!</p><p>“Uhm, Lady Rozemyne, May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of Life?”</p><p>Lord Wolfgang showed a second of irritation as the sweet Gretia began the greeting he should have given instead, while he and his wife still dared to remain standing.</p><p>“Oh my, Lord Wolfgang, I did not realize you conceded your position as head of the house to Gretia! How generous of you. Of course, Gretia, you may.”</p><p>Before Gretia could finish her greeting, Lord Wolfram hastily ordered her to stop, and kneeled to repeat the same greeting, his wife following with obvious reluctance. But Lady Rozemyne did not let this insult slide that easily.</p><p>“See, Gretia. Take this opportunity as Erwachlehren’s blessing. As you know, Gebordnung dictates that those of lesser status are to greet those above them, however if you offer your blessing before those who are supposed to lead you, Ordoschnelli may mistake it for Anhaltung’s guidance that you hold the highest standing in your group.”</p><p>“I-I see, thank you my Lady.”</p><p>Mathilde did not miss the nervous looks her new daughter was sending to her former guardians. Seeing a child look with fear at those intended to nurture them was making her blood boil slightly. She was glad she had witnessed so many of Glucklitat trials beforehand, allowing her to remain composed.</p><p>“It is important for everyone to know their place and uphold Gebordnung, you see? You should always know who needs to lead a greeting, and they should do so promptly, and without further instructions, to not lead to stray Ordoschnelli. That being said, Gebordnung also dictates to return the greeting at a speed appropriate for the difference in status.”</p><p>She let that sentence linger for a moment, before turning back to the still kneeling – and slowly reddening Lord Wolfgang.</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne smiled sweetly as she received the smallest blessing imaginable, and signaled for Mathilde to get her chair. Tea was served quickly, and to her utter shock, an area sound silencing tool was activated immediately, without even asking for consent! </p><p>“Leave the room.”</p><p>At Lord Wolfgang’s order, all the servants and attendants quickly put the tea down and left. Mathilde did not move. Who was he to order another’s attendant? She simply decided to not count the growing list of breaches of etiquette anymore.</p><p>“I said-”</p><p>“My, Lord Wolfgang, surely as a young lady I cannot be without my chaperone in the home of someone whose thread only just crossed mine for the first time, under Verbergen’s veil nonetheless? Perhaps you mistook my attendant for one of your own.”</p><p>The sweet tone of Lady Rozemyne made even her feel the pressure she was emitting, how could those fools remain unaffected?!</p><p>“Yes, perhaps I have. I do believe there is nothing for you to fear, however, with my wife and …daughter… present, you have plenty of chaperones. Would you not be more comfortable discussing such personal arrangements between just the four of us?”</p><p>Her Mistress tilted her head slightly in the perfect picture of a distressed Lady.</p><p>“Goodness, you could hardly count a sprout as young as myself, or someone who is not in my employ as my chaperone. I am afraid that if this was your attempt to ask for your wife to enter my service too, we would have to discuss that when Dregarnuhr crosses our thread once more, under the watch of my dear Wiegenmilch.”</p><p>She had to suppress her grin as Lord Wolfgang coloring reached a new level of redness at her Lady’s not at all subtle chastisement. Even more amusing was Lady Gertrude’s reaction as she nearly choked on her tea. She could not help herself as she put another one of her lady’s preferred snacks onto her plate to subtly show her approval.</p><p>“That is- Ehm, I believe you came here to discuss Gretia’s employment? Shall we move forward with that topic, perhaps?”</p><p>Lady Gertrude’s intervention had obviously not the desired effect as Lady Rozemyne regarded her with a slightly sharper tone than her bumbling buffoon of a husband.</p><p>“Ah yes, Lady Gertrude, how kind of you to remind me of your <em> kind invitation </em> in response to the meeting I requested with you. I wish not to be Anhaltung bringing bitter tunes, but I must say my father was rather surprised at the location of our tea party. Why he nearly summoned you himself! But of course that conversation is for your dear God of Darkness and my father to have, so let us allow Grammaratur to guide us back to Gretia entering my service.”</p><p>It was fascinating to watch as Lord Wolfgang lost his previous red coloring into a more white tone as he mayhaps finally became aware of the consequences of his actions. Lady Gertrude’s near panicky pacification attempt was as lacking as their blessing from Mestionora.</p><p>“A simple misunderstanding, no need for you to worry yourself, Lady Rozemyne, I am sure my husband can explain to Lord Guthfried whenever they next meet.”</p><p>“I do hope so for his own sake. It would be a pity for your house to face Verdraeos’ judgment over a <em> simple misunderstanding </em>… Now then, Gretia’s employment.”</p><p>At her Lady’s last words both of them paled slightly, but apparently Lord Wolfgang had retained some of his backbone.</p><p>“Yes, of course we would be honored for our Gretia to serve someone of archnoble status, however, I am sure you understand that as a loving father, I worry.”</p><p>“Oh, is that so? Do share these worries with me, perhaps I can be Anhaltung, bringing Heilschmerz and Flutrane to you.”</p><p>He clearly missed the edge in her Lady’s voice, and took her feigned concern as his sign to make more demands. His demeanor changed slightly, while he still looked somewhat pale, a predatory glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Ah, please take no offense, Lady Rozemyne, indeed serving you would benefit Gretia greatly, but I worry we would be robbing her of perhaps one day serving someone of even higher status. We would of course consider your offer if our house was <em> thoroughly compensated </em> for the potential future connections we would lose out on. I do believe two large golds is not too steep a price to ask.”</p><p>The gall of that man! Mathilde knew from her discussion with her Lady that they had mentioned these demands to their child, but to say it so directly to an archnoble! </p><p>“My, surely you couldn’t be referring to my time spent in service of the gods while Jugereise danced for Geduldh, could you? That may make one think of my status as lower than other archnobles, is that it?”</p><p>“So you understand.”</p><p>She nearly broke her composure at this blatant insult, how dare this… this filth calling her Lady lowly because of her upbringing?! As she steamed in her anger she nearly missed her Lady’s reply. </p><p>“On the other hand, one would think my <em> current </em> status in service of the Archduke’s oldest son, the future Aub Ehrenfest, may make one think of my status as much higher than other archnobles… As you said, Lord Wolfgang, your main concern is Dregarnuhr not crossing Gretia’s, and therefore your thread with others’, beyond those who Ventuchte weaved mine with. I must admit I am hard pressed to find who exactly would you be wishing to spin your threads tight with, if it isn’t Lady Veronica and the future aub of our duchy.”</p><p>It seemed Lady Rozemyne had finally had enough of those minions of Chaocipher, as her tone got so sharp even they could no longer misinterpret it. But it seemed they were even more bereft of Mestionora’s grace as Wolfgang regained some of his luster. <em> Again. </em></p><p>“Ah, well, you see…”</p><p>She watched as Rozemyne simply ignored Wolfgang and turned her attention to Gertrude next, the smile on her face practically screaming her growing anger to the world.</p><p>“Oh dear, Lady Gertrude! As we skipped all small talk, I only just noticed you do not appear to be using rinsham! As you can see, it does make one’s hair look ever so luxurious.”</p><p>Lady Gertrude seemed quite taken aback by the sudden change of topic, and simply agreed with an empty noble smile.</p><p>“Indeed, it is as if Kunstzeal blessed your hair herself, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>Her young mistress took a moment to slide her left hand through her long locks, to further showcase the difference, before leveling a mocking look at Gertrude. </p><p>“Lady Veronica was quite pleased with it herself, she even gifted some to her closest pillars. The tea party following it must have pleased Efflorelume beyond words, with all the attendees’ blessings amplified by rinsham. I do wish I could have attended it myself, if only it wasn’t so close to my baptism… Perhaps you could be my Ordoschnelli and tell me about it, Lady Gertrude?”</p><p>“I’m afraid I was also otherwise occupied, Lady Rozemyne. As you know, I am a mother after all, with a recently baptized child myself.”</p><p>Gertrude’s eye shifted to her husband a few times, apparently seeking his support or guidance, what a poor sight to witness in a grown up Lady of her standing. Where was all her previous confidence gone now, in the face of her Lady’s rightful anger? </p><p>“Ah, pardon my ignorance, Lady Gertrude, I had no idea that having a child my age would stop one from attending social gatherings. My Wiegenmilch had no issue attending a personal tea party with Lady Veronica herself just recently… I do hope your house has not fallen out of favor…”</p><p>“We most certainly have not!”</p><p>Wolfgang’s anger startled her slightly, but seemed to completely wash off Lady Rozemyne’s impeccable composure. She merely raised her left eyebrow before replying.</p><p>“That is all the more worrying to hear, Lord Wolfgang, your house not supporting Lady Veronica’s trend, and being dissatisfied with your daughter serving the <em> head knight </em> of the Archduke’s son… Not to mention allowing Angriff to guide your actions and ignoring Gebordnung in the presence of someone of higher status from your own faction… I do wonder how Lady Veronica would feel about your behavior today. Perhaps I should ask her when I next visit the castle.”</p><p>It took them a few moments to grasp her Lady's words fully, but after they did, both of them lost nearly all of their coloring and Mathilde had to suppress giving them an evil grin as they finally seemed to realize Lady Rozemyne’s standing. Wolfgang took out a handkerchief and began to remove his accumulating sweat. Meanwhile Gertude had seemingly frozen in fright, it was a poor, if satisfying sight to witness. It took her all not to cackle in delight. </p><p>“As I said, it is quite worrying that you were not graced with a gift of rinsham, but Greifechan may still allow you to show your support for your faction and its trend. In fact, you should have made arrangements for this already, shouldn’t you? I could of course be gracious, and sell you my very own gifted bottle from Lady Veronica. That would surely alleviate some of the suspicion of wishing to leave your faction from your house.”</p><p>“That would be most wonderful, Lady Rozemyne. I have in fact attempted to purchase some, but it has been so difficult for a mednoble house like ours to obtain it. The demand from archnobles is just too high, you see.”</p><p>Their new attitude towards Lady Rozemyne was much more to her liking, those vermin deserved to grovel after everything they did. She could not fault her mistress for beginning to abuse the power granted to her to punish those fools. In her opinion it was not even enough, and to her glee she seemed to agree with her assessment. She placed another additional snack on her plate.</p><p>“Indeed, it is quite the elusive product, making this sample all the more valuable. I do believe two large golds is not too steep a price to ask.”</p><p>Gertrude bowed her head in submission before hastily assuring their agreement.</p><p>“But of course, we are grateful.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne gave a short nod before continuing her verbal assault. </p><p>“Now then, while that alleviates <em> some </em> suspicion, I have heard enough to pray for Jugereise between my house and yours.”</p><p>It was the first time for young Gretia to react in any obvious way since their meeting started. Her eyes widened and she looked at Lady Rozemyne in shock. As those caricatures of parents were currently more occupied with her mistress she gave the fretting girl a reassuring nod, which seemed to calm her slightly. And the next words of her young charge only confirmed her reassurance.</p><p>“Should Ordoschnelli reach Lady Veronica that her grandson’s Leidenschaft purchased a servant from a house that is approaching the opposing faction, Verdraeos would be upon not only your house, but mine too. Therefore, Gretia will be adopted by a noble of my choosing.”</p><p>“That is absolutely out of the question!”</p><p>Wolfgang was truly bereft of even the slightest hint of Mestionoras blessing. The fool had even stood up in his anger, had he not realized his place even <em> now </em>? After her Lady had spelled it out for him?</p><p>“Very well, it seems Seheweit guided me well, our threads appear to be tangled.. As you continue to be emboldened by Angriff and blessed by Schneeahst, despite knowing my status, I have no choice but to take this as hostility towards not just myself but my charge as well. I’ll be Anhaltung to Aub Ehrenfest and Lady Veronica regarding your actions. I pray that Dregarnurh-”</p><p>She indicated for Mathilde to move the chair, which she of course complied with. Just as Lady Rozemyne had fully stood up she was stopped by the fearful plea of Gertude, who was still pale and looked at both of them in near desperation.</p><p>“Please wait! Please, Lady Rozemyne, forgive my husband, I beg of you, he spoke out of turn. We will of course do as you say!”</p><p>Her charge looked at Gertrude for a moment, before throwing a meaningful glance at Wolfgang. The fool quickly sat down again, bowing his head in submission. After regarding them both her mistress retook her own seat.</p><p>“...this is your last warning, Lord Wolfgang. Pray to Verfuhremeer and be mindful of Gebordnung, if you do not wish to make yourself appear any more suspicious.”</p><p>“Yes, I apologize. As you said, Gretia will be adopted.”</p><p>He was at least acting more appropriately for his station now, but it was much too late. After all the insults and missteps, Lady Rozemyne would hardly let him get away with simply agreeing to such a simple demand. Mathilde was sure she was about to witness the rude family get exactly what they deserve for their behavior.</p><p>“Naturally, you will cover any costs of the adoption, to show your willingness to cooperate.”</p><p>“...naturally.”</p><p>She did not like that the man still had this defiant undertone even now. Regardless, Lady Rozemyne continued in her demands.</p><p>“I could not help but note that I have only seen Gretia in a handful of outfits. I will graciously assume that she in fact has a full wardrobe of appropriate size for a mednoble, and she simply prefers these few outfits. I expect to see her <em> full </em> wardrobe to make its way to her new home within the season. That should be long enough for a seamstress to make any… <em> alterations </em>, if needed.”</p><p>“Of course she has a full wardrobe, in fact I often lament her lack of style, if only she cared more about her blessings from Efflorelume. Your consideration is very generous, indeed some of the dresses may need to be adjusted as they have not been worn in a while.”</p><p>It seemed Gertrude had grasped her situation much better than her husband, the quick assurance of the growing terms spoke volumes. It seemed poor Gretia was not only treated badly but outright abused. It was hard to conceal her own anger. It was more like they needed to be made because they don’t exist at all. But she did show any of her thoughts, as was only proper.</p><p>“Wonderful. Now then, Gretia?”</p><p>“Yes, Milady!”</p><p>The sheer enthusiasm in Gretia’s voice was startling, it was in such stark contrast to her previous demeanor. How did those fools manage to drop her opinion of them even lower still? Looking at Gretia right now was heartwarming to witness.</p><p>“Before we continue, I have a gift for you. Lord Wolfgang, if you could deactivate the tool so Gretia can call in her attendant?”</p><p>At least Wolfgang was beginning to learn to follow instructions, as he swiftly moved to the order without complaint. She watched as Gretia excused herself to ring a bell by the door. It took only moments before the door opened and the young girl began to speak with someone outside in hushed tones, before the servant girl from before entered. She was a laynoble attendant? From her bearing and name she would have taken the girl for a commoner, maybe she was mistaken. It was not that grave of an insult if they were greeted by Gretia’s own attendant.</p><p>“Gretia, this is a special protective charm I created. I am loaning this to you until your adoption is completed and you enter my service. If it is removed from you by someone else, or if you are harmed, it notifies me of your location and of the offender. May it support you through your transition between households.”</p><p>At Lady Rozemyne’s signal she presented a small box to Milly, but was taken aback as no customary checks were performed and she was about to simply hand the present to her charge directly. Luckily her Lady interfered.</p><p>“Stop right there. No matter how much Gretia may trust me, you should never hand over a gift to your lady without testing for poison. At least cast waschen on it.”</p><p>The girl named Milly immediately knelt with her arms crossed, trembling slightly. Mathilde raised an eyebrow, even if it was a chastisement it was too strong of a reaction.</p><p>“M- My deepest apologies for the oversight Milady! I am unable to do as you request. I am only a commoner you see. I am not versed in poisons, and I can’t use magic.”</p><p>Her own anger was nothing in comparison to Lady Rozemyne’s, whose weight of mana began to bubble to the surface, making everyone in the room tense up. The sheer anger in her voice was palpable.</p><p>“Gretia, where is your noble attendant?”</p><p>“I-I… I have no noble attendant, Lady Rozemyne. Just Milly.”</p><p>The weight doubled at her reply and Lady Rozemyne’s smile was twitching now at the corners of her mouth. And who could blame her? Hearing yet another level of abuse being revealed.</p><p>“Gretia, you and Milly should go to your room and pack your belongings. It appears to me that your move needs to happen more urgently than I expected. Me and your parents will have a conversation about <em> further arrangements </em> in the meanwhile.”</p><p>“Yes, Milady. Please excuse me, then.”</p><p>The poor dear wasted not a moment to depart the premise, her servant following her obediently. After the door had closed the ominous feeling of weight turned into outright pressure. It was hard for even her to remain standing as Lady Rozemyne unleashed her mana unto everyone in the room. Those poor fools did not stand a chance and were forced to their knees immediately. It was Gertrude who tried to pacify her Lady again.</p><p>“L- Lady Rozemyne, p- please wait I- I can expla-”</p><p>“Silence.”</p><p>She was nearly forced onto the ground herself as that single word was accompanied with a short increase in pressure. Even if the feeling of being crushed was awful she would not pity those fools, they had only themself to blame that her Lady finally lost her temper. She was glad Gertrude heeded the command, but prepared herself for another burst of pressure. Lady Rozemyne leveled her look at Wolfgang before speaking.</p><p>“You will acquire a noble attendant for Gretia, and you will pay for them until she is fully trained to serve me.”</p><p>“But- hrgh”</p><p>Her knees nearly buckled and it was becoming hard to breathe as the pressure grew <em> again, </em>and continued to hold its new level. She watched as Wolfgang clutched at his throat, apparently being crushed to a level depriving him of air. Meanwhile Gertrude was looking at Lady Rozemyne in obvious fear.</p><p>“I do not remember giving you the right to refuse, this was not a request but an <em> order. </em>I will be gracious one more time and grant you this last chance to not… displease me any further.”</p><p>“Please forgive us Lady Rozemyne! We will do as you command, but please release my husband. I beg of you!”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Her Lady was humming in thought, as Wolfgang had gone slightly purple in his face. It was obvious he was near suffocation by crushing. Gertrude alternated looking between her husband and Lady Rozemyne in mounting panic.</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>The pressure vanished as fast as it appeared, making her sigh slightly in relief. Wolfgang had dropped to the ground completely, gasping for air as his wife spoke in his stead.</p><p>“Thank you, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>Her young mistress moved to retake her seat at the table, before giving them a cold glance.</p><p>“Sit down, there is still the adoption contract to discuss.”</p><p>“Yes, of course!”</p><p>“A- As you wish Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>This newfound obedience of Wolfgang was much more to her liking. Her Lady directed her to present the adoption contract, which she prominently placed before her, before handing her Lady a mana pen. Lady Rozemyne wasted no time and began to articulate the terms of the contract. Wolfgang and Gertrude meanwhile remained blissfully silent, just exchanging fearful looks between them. It was at this moment that Gretia and her commoner servant returned, and informed them that her belongings were currently loaded into the carriage they arrived in. Mathilde raised an eyebrow at this information, the carriage they arrived in was for personal transportation only, there was not much room to load all of the girl’s belongings into. It seemed that her Lady agreed with the sentiment.</p><p>“You are able to take everything you own into just one carriage, which is supposed to transport us too?”</p><p>“Um yes, Milady. Is there a problem?”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne simply sighed and began to wordlessly add another clause to the contract, making her parents responsible for the procurement of the missing necessities. At this point it looked more like a shopping list than an adoption contract, she had to suppress her anger at those enemies of Wiegenmilch again. Meanwhile Gretia looked on in slight apprehension at the silence between the present parties.</p><p>After Lady Rozemyne had finished writing the contract she ordered her to present it to Wolfgang and Gertrude.</p><p>“Please read the terms of this contract, even if I will not allow you to refuse them you should at least be aware of them. I will not have you forsake Gebordnung due to the lack of Anhaltung’s blessings. After you read it, sign it.”</p><p>After beginning to read it Wolfgang hesitated before signing, causing her Lady to unleash her mana once again, at least she only needed to make them feel the oppressive nature of it before he hastily signed the contract before handing it to Gertrude, who after reading did not show any form of resistance and signed immediately. She nearly broke into a grin as Gretia was handed the contract, her eyes got wider the more she read. After she had finished she stared at her parents in disbelief, which soured her mood again.</p><p>“Sign the contract Gretia, Dregaruhr's weaving stops for no one.”</p><p>“Ah, I am sorry Milady!”</p><p>After the young girl hastily signed the contract was handed to her and after confirming it was the previous stated terms, in addition to the reemployment of the servant girl Milly, she signed the contract too. Watching it burning up in golden flames meant she now had a new daughter to care for so she gently instructed Gretia to go ahead with Milly and wait in the carriage for them. Her daughter bowed to everyone present before excusing herself once again.</p><p>“As promised I will refrain from being Anhaltung to Lady Veronica of what happened today. So long as you do not make me regret it, Ordoschnelli will not fly.”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Rozemyne. We are thankful for your gracious lenience.”</p><p>“It is as my Goddess of Light stated, we are grateful for your leniency, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>After those words her Lady withdrew the pressure of her mana again, before smiling at them with her most beautiful lady smile.</p><p>“While our threads are tangled no more, the day will most likely never come when Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, weaves our threads back together, but I pray that you live in peace with the divine protection of the gods.”</p><p>And with those words they made their way out of this cursed mansion, ignoring the warry looks of the other servants. She could not wait to show her poor new daughter what a true Wiegenmilch and Erwachlehren was supposed to be.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Being selected as the head knight of the archduke's son was the greatest honor he could receive. It might have been a daunting task for anyone else, but growing up listening to his father's tales about Lord Sylvester's daily mischief prepared him for any challenge the role could bring. Or so he thought…</p><p>The tales from his father sounded like fun adventures, however in reality, his work felt more like Glucklitat's trial. His young charge, like any other child, was not very keen on his lessons, and much preferred to run and play instead. Much of his days were spent running after the little boy, who started getting faster and sneakier as Dregarnuhr spun her thread. The very first time he caught his charge during his mission to escape his math instructor and forced him back to his lesson, he was faced with an even bigger shock. Rather than praise him for a job well done, he was severely reprimanded by Lady Veronica herself! In that moment, he feared he may even ascend to the towering heights, but he was simply given some corrections. Apparently the mother of the Archduke wished for her grandson to keep his youthful spirit, and was opposed to any strict education and schedule. </p><p>After discussing this information with Oswald, Lord Wilfried’s head attendant, they came to the conclusion that it was best to allow their charge to lead them in how to best please Lady Veronica. As a responsible guard knight, he of course made sure to stay near his lord, but he no longer tried to force him back into his lessons. He even gave in and allowed his charge a bit of headway every now and then. Their effort seemed to be rewarded, as Lady Veronica doted on Lord Wilfried, who in turn was happier than ever.</p><p>The only downside was his lack of progress in his education and manners. Rumors started to circulate in the castle, but Lady Veronica made no attempt to change her opinion on how her grandson should be raised. They even made sure to deliver reports to her scholars on a regular basis, but all was well it seemed.</p><p>That was until one fateful day after the debut of the new noble children during his lord's sixth winter. As he was off duty that day, he was forced through social niceties the whole evening, and heard of the incident the following day only, but what he heard brought back memories of his first scolding. Lady Veronica came to check on Lord Wilfried after the debuts, and found the young lord lacking. Their worst nightmare of angering the most powerful person in the duchy came true due to a lapse in Grammaratur conveying Anhaltung’s message. Rather than support their charge to be the capable but still happy future aub Lady Veronica desired, they sabotaged him. The consequences were bound to be dire.</p><p>The tension was palpable all through the following days, as every bell ringing at the door to signal someone's arrival, every sound of flapping wings made them all on edge, expecting their punishment to be delivered.</p><p>“Lamprecht, this is Karstedt. I expect your attendance at today’s lunch at fourth bell.”</p><p>The Ordonnaz repeated itself two more times before reverting its form. The clear order made him feel slightly anxious. Glucklitat appeared to select him to be the first to face her trial. Nevertheless he gave his reply.</p><p>“Lord Karstedt, this is Lamprecht. I will be present.”</p><p>He watched as the Ordonnanz flew away to deliver his reply, he could not suppress a tired sigh.</p><p>“Are you feeling alright Lamprecht?”</p><p>The touching question from his own charge of all people did nothing to lift his current mood. He forced himself to smile at Lord Wilfried before giving his reply.</p><p>“It is nothing you need to worry about, my Lord. I was just surprised by the sudden invitation, please do not mind me.”</p><p>“Oh, alright then.”</p><p>Lord Wilfried returned his attention back to his current lesson, and honestly he was just glad his lord did not try to escape so far. The anger of Lady Veronica was still hovering over their heads after all. </p><p>Dregarnuhr spun her thread agonizingly slowly until third and a half bell when he was relieved from his post and could make his way to the Linkberg estate. He was greeted by attendants as usual who took his cloak, but instead of leading him to the small parlor where he and Cornelius often took their lunch with their mother, they headed to the large dining hall.</p><p>“There you are, Lamprecht! Come, sit by my side!”</p><p>He barely set a foot inside the room when his grandfather’s voice boomed in his direction, completely disorienting him. He knew his father would be present, both from the ordonnanz and from the room they were using for lunch, but his grandfather? Was this not the punishment for his failings as a knight, but a different family matter entirely? Has he been fretting for no reason?</p><p>A different kind of unease settled in his chest as he gave his greetings and sat down at the table between his father and grandfather, across from his mother. He was itching to ask what was going on, but the piercing glare of his mother let him know they will not be breaking protocol over whatever the issue was. So he answered her questions over how her day was and the weather and whatever other inconsequential things she wanted to talk about as he dunked the slice of hard bread into the flavorless liquid of his soup and fished for potatoffels and mehren. He normally preferred soups heavy on the meat, but not knowing what this family meeting was about made him feel like a mana stone formed where his stomach should be. He could barely touch the steamed tschnitz meat that was served after.</p><p>Finally the tea was served, and as the air in the room shifted and his father and grandfather turned serious, he dearly wished for Vantole’s support with the talks to come.</p><p>“Lamprecht, I have news to bring you from the Archduke.”</p><p>His father began in a grave voice, making him tense slightly in apprehension. He looked at his father as he was informed what was to be his punishment.</p><p>“As you know, you have been found lacking as a head knight. Your consistent lack of ability to contain your charge to the safety of his chambers and encourage him to take part in his education has led to dire circumstances that can no longer be ignored. Aub Ehrenfest has decided on a fitting punishment for your failings, but graciously allowed us to handle the situation delicately within the family.”</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw that Grandfather was frowning intensively. It did nothing to soothe the growing dread in his stomach, did his father really need to stretch the sentence out so much? </p><p>“As of this moment, you are relieved of your duty as Lord Wilfried’s head knight.”</p><p>He felt like someone suddenly cast waschen over him with no warning, his breath caught in his chest and Schneeahst grazed his skin. So this was it, then. He could be a knight no longer. He could perhaps join the Knight Order under his father’s guidance and protection, but no noble of any duchy would employ a knight in their retinue who was discharged by the archducal family.</p><p>“A rather surprising decision from Lord Sylvester even in the face of Lamprecht’s failure, after the support our family has provided him and his over the years, don’t you think?”</p><p>His mother spoke casually, but he knew her well enough to notice the cold fury in her eyes as she questioned his father. His heart warmed slightly at the concern, but the panic was still more prominently on his mind. His father also seemed to have noticed his mother’s displeasure as he hurriedly continued.</p><p>“Lord Sylvester was indeed quite torn over the matter, but with Lady Veronica’s knowledge of the matter, this demotion could not be avoided.”</p><p>A demotion? He was only getting demoted? That would mean he could still continue serving his charge, and his honor would be preserved somewhat. No one outside of the archducal family knew of the status of Lord Wilfried’s retainers yet, and having to be second in command to Heinrich - his current second in command - would in fact be a very light punishment!</p><p>“None of the other knights in the young lord’s service come from families even close to our standing. Any of them outranking Lamprecht would be quite an insult not only to our family but the Leisegang clan as a whole. Who, pray tell my dear husband, does Lord Sylvester plan to replace our Lamprecht with?”</p><p>It was true that while Heinrich was just a mednoble, his family’s standing was closer to that of a poor archnoble, so not even close to a branch family like theirs. Both of them got along well so the changed dynamic would not impact him that much, even if it would feel awkward in the beginning. He would simply have to adjust, maybe after some time he could even regain his former status!</p><p>“There’s no need to worry about an insult, Elvira, Lord Wilfried’s new head knight, Rozemyne is from a Veronican branch family and already easily stands above any of your children in combat ability.”</p><p>Bonifatius scoffed, but his words betrayed his pride. It stung a little. Rozemyne… Where had he heard that name… The image of the little girl his grandfather recently started training flashed in his mind, but he dismissed it immediately. Sure, the girl’s name was Rozemyne too, but she was just a little kid, barely past her baptism. His replacement had to be a different Rozemyne. He was curious about the girl after hearing her sing at the winter debut, admittedly, but now was not the time for his thoughts to wander.</p><p>“Oh my~”</p><p>His mother’s entire demeanor changed, her previous anger vanishing near instantly, before being replaced with… something else. He was not sure if she was genuinely surprised, or curious. To him it seemed almost happy? Why was his mother happy hearing about his replacement?! His Father was apparently just relieved his mother had lost her previous anger. To be honest he felt relieved too, witnessing his mother’s anger was not for the faint of heart, even if it was in his stead. Still, why was she reacting to a simple name like…that?</p><p>“Still, for her to be serving under that boy… What a waste…”</p><p>His grandfather grumbled under his breath,and Lamptrecht had to force himself not to take it personally. He knew how his unconventional grandfather thought more with his instincts than his mind, so it didn’t surprise him that much that he considered serving under someone as a waste. But he still wished he was lamenting his own fate, not some girl’s… Wait, he had to serve under a girl?!</p><p>As if that information was not shocking enough, he saw to his utter shock and frustration, his mother sighed - actually sighed!</p><p>“Of course Lady Veronica would move to secure little Rozemyne for herself, but to think she would act so quickly… Just when we thought there was a chance for the house to join our faction. Alas, Dragarnuhr decreed it not to be so.”</p><p>Were they even still discussing his fate or Rozemyne’s?!</p><p>“It is still a waste, I say! Lord Wilfried has much to learn if he wishes to be worthy of Rozemyne’s loyalty.”</p><p>What was Grandfather even talking about? In which world did the heir of the archduke have the need to impress his own subordinate?!</p><p>“Ehm, I do not think Lord Wilfried had any involvement in the matter, Father… All that is certain is she will be his head knight from now on instead of Lamprecht, but he can still serve as part of his retinue. This was the decision Aub Ehrenfest wished me to convey.”</p><p>His fathers awkward intersection did not help to raise his mood at all. He just hoped they would finally talk about his fate instead of talking about some girls!</p><p>“And… You are really okay with this, Father?”</p><p>“Questioning the Archduke’s decision is treason, so be careful with your words, son. You have failed at your task as a knight, and now you must face the consequences.”</p><p>His Grandfather struck the table with his fist, nearly causing the tea to spill. The action earned him a disapproving glare of his mother, which he completely ignored, as usual of course.</p><p>“Indeed, this is your own doing, Lamprecht. Learn to live with it like a man!”</p><p>He turned to his mother as his last hope for any empathy, but received only a smile in return.</p><p>“Glucklitat has deemed it necessary to present you with another trial, my dear. I have faith that you will face this trial head on and receive Anwachs’ blessing in turn.”</p><p>“I suppose… I will do my best to not disappoint you again, Father, Mother. However… I am not even sure what my new role will be like. I have trained under instructors, but only protected my charge as his head knight until now.”</p><p>His father, rather than giving him the advice he was hoping for, just scratched his head with a torn expression.</p><p>“There is still a chance that this demotion is in name only… From what I heard, Rozemyne will still be given plenty of time to continue her training in the meanwhile, and she will be tasked with teaching the young lord too.”</p><p>The interjection of his father caught the attention of his mother and grandfather in equal measure. But before his mother could begin to ask her questions his grandfather brought his fist down at the table, <em> again </em>. The rattling of the tableware earned him another baleful look from Elvira.</p><p>“That’s my disciple for you! Having the presence to negotiate better treatment for herself even in the face of Lady Veronica! I have praised her when she informed me of the details of the agreement, but I would not have allowed for a contract to be signed with anything less!”</p><p>“Oh my, oh my, she negotiated for it herself, did she? Indeed, father in law, that is a great accomplishment for a seven year old.”</p><p>Seven?! Wait, they were talking about <em> that </em> Rozemyne? He was supposed to be subordinate to a seven year old girl?! He was about to voice his misgivings but his mother spoke up again.</p><p>“Ah but for the child to be Erwachlehren <em> and </em> Leidenschaft? Is Lord Wilfried throwing away the Dark God’s cape in favor of the spear?”</p><p>“Ah, I don’t know about these things, Elvira. Nothing of the sort was mentioned in the meeting between Lord Sylverster and Lady Veronica.”</p><p>His father was quick as always in shifting responsibility away to others, in pacifying his mother. But she did not seem satisfied with his answer, as she continued to question him.</p><p>“...Yes, I expect it would not be said outright. For an observant knight, I wish you could notice the subtleties in the art of Grammaratur as you do in the domain of Angriff, my dear husband. Still, no matter how accomplished little Rozemyne is, I cannot imagine her seeing this new role as a blessing from any of the gods…”</p><p>“You are right as always, Elvira. My dear disciple confessed to me that she wished to avoid Lady Veronica’s notice entirely from the beginning, but ultimately found accepting the offer more to her benefit than refusing it. Of course, one of her talents could not be hidden from the ones ruling the heavens, but as her teacher it is my duty to refuse these unreasonable offers for her!”</p><p>It seemed he had to accept that the conversation had completely shifted to only cover the ‘plight’ of Rozemyne, instead of his own demotion. Even if he wanted to shout his complaints to the heavens he remained silent so gather as much information about his new <em> superior </em> as possible. Even if he had to bear witness as his mother continued to… gush… about Rozemyne.</p><p>“Indeed, she is already too accomplished at her age to remain under Verbergen’s shroud. I do believe it was rather smart of her to accept the burden and use Lady Veronica’s influence to her own benefit rather than rely on your protection, father in law.”</p><p>Grandfather leveled a stern look at his mother. A frown prominent on his face.</p><p>“What do you mean to imply, Elvira?”</p><p>“Her strength, intelligence and musical talent is too dangerous to not be under the control of a woman so blessed by Eifersuneid. You cannot protect her in ladies’ society where she is at the mercy of her host.”</p><p>His father interrupted their staring contest with a mumble.</p><p>“Ah, so that’s why she’ll be teaching Lord Wilfried the harspiel and singing…”</p><p>“My dear God of Darkness… Do you mean to imply that Rozemyne will be Lord Wilfried’s Erwachlehren not in the matters of Leidenschaft but in the domain of Kunstzeal? Could you not have mentioned your knowledge earlier? Knowledge which clearly implied Lady Veronica’s preference of the dark cloak for Lord Wilfried?!”</p><p>His mother changed her frosty glare at her husband instead of his grandfather. He was just glad not to be the target of her ire, and his father seemed to agree with his preferences as he leaned back in his seat a little. As if the slightly increased distance would protect him from his wife’s anger.</p><p>“Ah, now that you mention it… I would have mentioned it earlier of course, but seeing as you had tea with the girl, and she is my father’s disciple, I assumed you would be in possession of this information with your excellent scholarly skills.”</p><p>His mother simply sighed tiredly at his fathers poor showing of using flattery to deflect her ire. He could not question its usage though, as his mother changed topics, before cradling her head in her hands in…resignation?</p><p>“Perhaps Lady Veronica was blessed by Seheweit in more ways than one. If the children spend time together not only while Rozemyne guards Lord Wilfried, but also while sharing Kunstzeal’s blessings… Had Dregarnuhr forsaken me, or is Liebeskhilfe unwilling to lend me her aid? Bluanfah would most certainly dance between the girl and her charge before she could grow a rafel for my Cornelius…”</p><p>Wait just a moment! His mother was trying to play Liebeskhilfe between his brother and this girl? And now she even assumed his lord would fall for her too?! </p><p>“As if I would let such a useless brat bind his stars to my disciple!”</p><p>This time the aggressive thumbing of his grandfathers first on the table <em> did </em>cause the tea to be spilled everywhere. Earning him a cold reprimand of his mother before she summoned her schtappe and cast waschen on the table.</p><p>“Father in law, need I remind you that my husband is the head knight of the father of the very same child you just called a useless brat? Do pray to Verfuhremeer and Duldsetzen, lest you bring Verdrenna’s thunder down on our house. The Chaocipher wearing the Goddess of Light’s crown may already be placing pieces on the gewinnen board against us that we do not yet see.”</p><p>His grandfather’s bearing shifted, now seemingly even more serious, as he stared at his mother with intense focus.</p><p>“Do you suspect something, Elvira?”</p><p>“Not in detail, but this change in roles will have implications once Lord Wilfried is baptized. The daughter of the Thorwaechters will be seen by his side at the highest position of trust, while our Lamprecht is below her in status. As long as Karsted is Lord Sylvester’s head knight, our family still retains our rank as a close branch family, but if Lord Wilfried’s retinue is an indication of the future…”</p><p>His mother drifted off in her explanation, letting her last words hang in the air ominously, making everyone tense. The topic of discussion now beginning to drift in a completely different direction, as his father spoke up this time.</p><p>“There’s the mismanagement of the chalices to the Leisegang territories too, that even Lord Sylvester dismisses due to Lady Veronica’s insistence that they are exaggerated. I don’t expect Lord Wilfried to take it any more seriously in the future. And now some foul Ordoschnelli is starting to circulate of even neutral Giebes, like Illgner. Even I, as his head knight and most trusted retainer, don't have Lord Sylvester’s ear to warn him what this means for the future.”</p><p>“Lady Florencia wishes not to be involved in any aspect of Ehrenfest that would bring her more of Lady Veronica’s ire either. She wouldn’t even challenge her for custody of her own son…”</p><p>His grandfather simply scoffed in derision as he crossed his arms upon hearing Elvira speak after his father.</p><p>“Of course she won’t. I did not expect anything else from her.” </p><p>An uncomfortable silence fell on the room. It seemed the news of his demotion and the future humiliation he had to look forward to, serving under a girl much below his own age, was not the most pressing issue on his family’s mind. Knowing how much trouble this one single decision could cause them all made him begin to resent the girl before he even properly met her. She should have just stayed away from his grandfather and his charge in the first place…</p><p>“Perhaps we should change the tea. I am quite parched seeing that I did not get to finish my previous cup before it was spilled…”</p><p>His mother eventually gestured for a servant to refill their cups which were mostly empty after his grandfather’s outburst anyways. As was proper, his mother used the new tea to change the topic and lighten the mood somewhat after the heavy topics they discussed.</p><p>He did not contribute much to the rest of the conversation either, as topics shifted to matters that did not concern him nor sang the news of their doom any longer. Still, he could not help his thoughts from wandering to his future in anticipation of meeting his new <em> superior </em>.</p><p>Dregarnuhr did not have long to continue her spinning until the day arrived when Rozemyne would be presented to his young charge. He watched as Oswald took his leave to fetch the young girl, causing Lord Wilfried to look at him with questions in his eyes.</p><p>“What did Oswald mean? Do I get another retainer?”</p><p>He did his best to smile at his lord. Why did Oswald not inform him himself, did he have to burden him with delivering the message of his arriving replacement?</p><p>“Indeed, my lord. Rozemyne should have arrived at the castle now, so it falls unto Oswald, your head attendant, to greet and escort her to your chambers. May I remind you that your grandmother spoke to you earlier about finding a new teacher?”</p><p>“Right! I remember now, thank you Lamprecht. Rozemyne… that sounds like a girl’s name. All of my retainers are guys, so why now a girl?”</p><p>He nearly grimaced at the blunt way lord Wilfried was still speaking even now. He just hoped their struggle to correct his education would show results soon. Rozemyne was practically sent to oversee their progress, even if it was not outright stated. But Lady Veronica’s interest in the young girl spoke volumes about whose opinion she would trust most after their blunder was revealed…</p><p>“Do not worry my lord. It may be… special circumstances, but she comes highly recommended, I have been told.”</p><p>Thankfully lord Wilfried returned his attention back to his current lesson, learning the alphabet. He let his thoughts wander slightly before he saw Oswald enter the room again.</p><p>“My lord, I have brought with me your new retainer. She is currently awaiting the honor of your presence in the entry room.”   </p><p>“She is here already? Let’s go Lamprecht!”</p><p>He could only blink as his lord bolted from his lesson and began to run in the direction of where their new colleague was waiting. He exchanged a resigned look with Oswald, before following his energetic charge. Where he took his usual place, the left side of his back.</p><p>“-in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of life?”</p><p>“Oh, sure!”</p><p>He winced as his charge failed at even the first steps of noble customs, the slight hesitation of Rozemyne before she finished the greeting was only amplifying the painful feeling, currently developing in his stomach.</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>As the young girl stood up he finally got his first proper look at her. Rozemyne had midnight-blue hair which reached her lower back. Her golden eyes appeared to be glowing, but it was most likely just his imagination. The only way to describe the young girl was “pretty”. No wonder his mother was gushing about her non-stop since the family meeting, even Lamprecht had to admit she would be turning heads in just a few short years. He was taken out of his inspection of Rozemyne and nearly lost his composure at his lord's next words.</p><p>“Woah, you're really pretty.”</p><p>He watched with dread as Rozemyne sent a subtle glance at Oswald, who averted his eyes in apparent unease. She looked at Wilfried again before giving her answer, wearing a noble Lady smile.</p><p>“Oh my, you flatter me with your words, Lord Wilfried. Being praised for their abundant blessings of Efflorelume is most pleasing for any lady to hear. But fear not, I am not unfamiliar with the art of Grammaratur, you need not abandon Verbergen’s shroud for my sake. It is best to avoid any misunderstandings, after all. Seeing as I am to become Erwachlehren in addition to Leidenschaft in your service, it would only attract off-tune Ordoschnelli to fly.”</p><p>“Um… what?”</p><p>He had to suppress a wince again but could not resist looking at his feet in shame of his lord's demeanor. The fact Rozemyne was already exposed to his lacking behavior, not even long into their first meeting was worrying in the extreme.</p><p>“Um maybe you should forgo the dance of Grammaratur for now, Rozemyne?”</p><p>He glanced at Oswald in slight shock. Was he not aware of what his words were implying? He should have at least tried to preserve Lord Wilfried’s honor! He shuddered slightly when Rozemyne began to question Oswald directly.</p><p>“You mean to say our lord was not instructed in the abundant dancing in Grammaratur, a crucial skill of all noblemen? Was it not your own duty as Erwachlehren to bring Mestionora’s grace, to guide him in his spring days, that he may enter his first steps into summer unburdened?”</p><p>The sheer coldness in her voice spoke volumes of what she thought about all of them. Oswald stammering did not help matters at all.</p><p>“I- Ahem, that may be going a bit far but…Yes.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at Oswald for a moment more before outright ignoring both of them, as she began to give Lord Wilfried an impromptu lesson on the spot! He could do without the thinly veiled insults at them, but they could not argue against them. Indeed it was their failure as lord Wilfried’s retainers for his lacking education, but it still hurt slightly to be reminded of it. But apparently the way she began to teach his lord was effective, as he began to absorb her lessons eagerly. He even thanked her for the lesson afterwards!?</p><p>“I have much to think about, thank you for your honest words, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She bowed her head at lord Wilfried gracefully.</p><p>“Do not worry about thanking me, Lord Wilfried. It is my duty to advise and serve you from now on.”</p><p>He watched as Oswald took Rozemyne to an adjacent room, apparently to give her some information she would require, so he escorted Lord Wilfried back to his previous lesson. His charge appeared to be thinking deeply as he walked back to his desk, before sitting down and shaking his head and refocusing back on learning the alphabet with newfound vigor. Was it truly so easy to get him motivated to learn? He did not like this new feeling of inadequacy at all. </p><p>The next day would be the start of the harspiel and singing lessons Rozemyne was to give lord Wilfried. His lord was as reluctant as ever, until the young girl made a surprising offer.</p><p>“Maybe it would be more motivation to experience the joys of Kunstzeal’s gift firsthand. May I offer to give a demonstration, my lord?”</p><p>Wilfried just looked at her questioningly before addressing her.</p><p>“You mean you want to show me how to play? My last teacher did that too, I do not understand what is so good about playing harspiel…”</p><p>Rozemyne appeared undaunted by the rebuke.</p><p>“Yes my lord. That is part of what I am offering. I meant to show you how the full experience would look. May I show you how the song you need to learn will sound, singing and instrumental parts included?”</p><p>Lamprecht was about to intervene, he did not need a repeat of Rozemyne’s debut. But before he could say anything lord Wilfried responded eagerly?</p><p>“So I can just listen to you for my lesson and don’t need to play that thing myself? Sure, show me!”</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>He could do nothing as Rozemyne readjusted slightly in her seat to get more comfortable. The rest of the entourage looked on in curious excitement, and he could hardly blame them for it. They were not present when Rozemyne sang at her debut, so it was natural for them to be at least curious, given it was talked about in every social circle those days. He tried to brace himself as best he could, his hand wandering in the direction of his pouch containing his feystones as the first notes of music began to fill the air and she began to sing.</p><p>As he got lost in Rozemyne’s singing voice he tried to focus his thoughts on Aurelia, imagining her singing the very same lighthearted spring melody for him. It was like being in a trance, before being gently guided back to reality as the performance ended. He looked around, everyone was still processing Rozemynes singing while staring at her. He was reminded of the chaos at her debut, he did not even want to imagine what would happen if she sang a song of romantic nature…</p><p>As everyone was beginning to regain their composure he looked at lord Wilfried who was still staring at Rozemyne absolutely spellbound, his eyes sparkling. He shuddered as his mother’s fear seemed to become a reality, if Lord Wilfried’s reaction was anything to go by he was already becoming infatuated with the girl! His lord seemingly recovered and mumbled to himself, thanks to his close proximity he heard every word of it. He squashed the sudden need to hold his head at the words uttered. </p><p>“So beautiful…”</p><p>His lord shook his head before addressing Rozemyne, more motivated in his music lessons than he had ever seen him before.</p><p>“Your singing is really pretty! I see what you mean now, it is so different from what my previous teachers did.”</p><p>“Oh my Lord Wilfried, did we not already cover that you need not abandon Verbergen’s shroud for my sake. Your praise of my blessings of Kunstzeal are not that much different from your previous comments, praising my blessings of Efflorelume.”</p><p>“...But you <em> are </em> really pretty, and a good singer too. Why can I not praise you for it?”</p><p>Lamprecht’s desire to hold his head continued to grow. Did his lord not realize how his words could be taken?!</p><p>“… My lord, do forgive me for my directness. What you just told me could be taken as a confession, or the showcase of your desire to court me with the intention of marriage. Please consider your choice of words more carefully, it would not do for the heir of the archduke to speak those words to his own lowly retainer, or any other girl if you do not wish to convert this exact intention. That is why we use the names of the gods.”</p><p>“...So it is acceptable if I say you are heavily blessed by Kunstzeal and Efflorelume instead? And you are not lowly…”</p><p>He watched helplessly as Rozemyne simply smiled at their lord while shaking her head.</p><p>“No it is not Lord Wilfried. You may praise my blessings of Kunstzeal, seeing as I am your teacher in the arts. But under no circumstance should you make any comments about the fact you find me blessed by Efflorelume. It would imply you find me attractive, which could still be taken as a confession. In some cases, it could even imply an insult, despite your intentions to compliment. It is best to avoid until such nuances are clear to you.”</p><p>“But I- Urgh…”  </p><p>He was so glad that Rozemyne decided to change topics, seeing the growing rafel of their lord towards her was painful to watch.</p><p>“May I suggest we focus back on your lessons, my Lord? I know you are not this interested in Kunstzeal’s domain, but once you have mastered the beginning of this melody, I could offer to give another demonstration if you like it so much?”</p><p>“Really?! You would? Ok, show me how to hold my fingers on the harspiel again please!”</p><p>It seemed after her performance Lord Wilfried lost any resemblance of resistance to any further lesson, even becoming motivated after Rozemyne’s obvious bribe. It was pitiful to watch, but if it prevented him from failing his coming debut nobody could really complain. So he held his tongue for now. The ability to resist such simple manipulation could be gained later, when they were not desperate to fix his education. Still to see a young girl wrapping his lord around her little finger with barely any effort was hard to stomach. As the lessons came to a close it was his turn to ‘teach’ Rozemyne about the duties and current proceedings she would need to be aware of as his lord’s future head knight. So both of them excused themselves to the currently empty entry room. But before he began his instructions he could not resist voicing his own opinion about her previous manipulation of their lord.</p><p>“Rozemyne, one moment before we talk about your duties as head knight of Lord Wilfried.”</p><p>“Oh? Is something the matter, <em> Lord </em>Lamprecht?”</p><p>It appeared his relaxed approach was not appreciated if the soft clarification of her address was anything to go by. He simply waved his hand before addressing the issue.</p><p>“No, well, yes. Do just call me Lamprecht, we are now both retainers of Lord Wilfried, after all.”</p><p>“Very well, is that all?”</p><p>He took a deep breath before voicing his thoughts to the young girl.</p><p>“I wished to discuss your conduct during the music lesson with Lord Wilfried. I found your blatant misuse of our lord’s interest in your performance most inappropriate. I wished to give you an opportunity to explain yourself, as I do not yet know you well.”</p><p>He was not prepared for the cold look Rozemyne directed his way. The smile on her face reminded him of his mother, when she was about to chastise him for some sort of misconduct. He had to suppress a shudder at the memory.</p><p>“My, how gracious of you. I appreciate you communicating your concern to me first so that we can clear this misunderstanding. As you know, our lord <em> must </em> succeed in his winter debut performance, for which Dregarnurh has already spun most of his thread in preparation of, regardless how unfortunate it may seem. It would bring me the utmost joy to delicately weave the dance of Grammaratur with our lord, however the Goddess’ blessing seems to have been withheld from him by Erwachlehren just as much as Kunstzeal’s or Mestionora’s.”</p><p>He was doing his best to not bristle at the thinly veiled insult. He knew they failed in their duty to educate their lord before, but hearing those words spoken to him by a young girl was making it hard to control his rising temper. </p><p>“It is indeed unfortunate that our lord must prepare in such a short time, however your approach was still beyond inappropriate for a retainer. If you cannot assure me that it will not happen again, I’m afraid I must report this incident to Lord Sylvester.”</p><p>“I cannot promise that Ventuchte's patterns won’t repeat, however I can assure you that all my actions have been and will be guided by those who rule the heavens, and wish for our lord to reach his full potential. I myself loathe to use Grammaratur as Verbergen, but it is what we must do until his blessings are deemed appropriate by Lady Veronica.”</p><p>Was that not a confession that she intended to ignore his warnings? Who was this girl thinking she was, trying to use Lady Veronica as a shield for her actions?! He took a deep breath to calm himself before speaking again. </p><p>“I believe you think you are acting in Lord Wilfried’s best interest and on Lady Veronica’s order, Rozemyne, however as someone who has been in your new position for many of our lord’s summers, I implore you to reconsider.”</p><p>“Lamprecht, your concerns have been noted, however as someone who is in my current position right now, I must remind you to respect my judgment. You no longer receive Lady Veronica’s guidance. I do.”</p><p>He shook his head at the arrogant young girl. No one could fully predict Lady Veronica’s intentions. He looked at her sternly, his tone reflecting his growing frustration more than he originally intended to. </p><p>“One must not assume what Lady Veronica’s intentions are, and while your actions worked to get Lord Wilfried motivated for now, they will stop working as he grows bored of you. When that day comes, your blatant manipulation will leave him more vulnerable, without any benefits to show.”</p><p>“Mestionora has not abandoned me to a degree that I could not guide a young sprout around Flutrane’s changes. I have long wondered how Ventuchte’s weaving could have led to such a curse from Glucklitat, right under the nose of the Supreme Couple. I see now that you must have fallen so deep into Schlaftraum’s realm, you missed the changing seasons entirely. When Gebordnung fails, one should always assume a failing of Anhaltung, rather than the hands of Chaocipher at play, but to see such disarray... Chaocipher would be more welcome than a Leidenschaft doused so deep in Vantole’s bounty, he cannot even see Mestionora’s departure.”</p><p>It took him a short moment to fully grasp what the young girl had just spoken to him. His temper flared, not unlike Elpberg as it erupted in similar fury. Rozemyne had stepped out of bounds, clearly overestimating her current standing! How dare she imply that he was too drunk on power and lost in his dreams to notice the issues! To say it would be better if he was malicious against Lord Wilfried than simply <em> too stupid </em> was beyond what he was willing to tolerate!?</p><p>“You are speaking above your station, Rozemyne! I was merely attempting to be Anhaltung, but it seems to me you are confusing the Goddess of Order with Chaocipher. I see now you cannot easily be reasoned with. I hereby challenge you to a duel!” </p><p>“Your pride is hurt, I see, but I see no reason to accept such a challenge.”</p><p>He could not help himself but show a mocking grin on his face at the clear unwillingness for her to fight him.</p><p>“Seeing as you are Lord Bonifatius' <em> prized disciple </em>, I am sure you will not refuse. What would my grandfather say if he knew you ran from a fight?”</p><p>He was not expecting for her to chuckle at his blunt provocations. She was even looking at him with something akin to pity now, the nerve of this girl!</p><p>“My, and here I thought you opposed blatant manipulation. However, you do make a good point. I have no doubt my Master would not care if I refused your challenge, however, seeing that he is your <em> grandfather </em> … A duel with you would be most interesting, as his <em> grandson </em> should be able to <em> easily </em> match a disciple he’s been training for <em> a mere season </em>, should you not, Lamprecht?”</p><p>“I welcome the opportunity to show you the skills needed to be a head knight. Consider it part of your education. Tomorrow should work fine, after finishing our duties, should it not?”</p><p>It was possibly somewhat underhanded of him to mask his desire for that duel as a lesson concerning her duties as head knight, but he did not care at this point. This arrogant young girl needed her own personal lesson in humility!</p><p>“Yes, better make sure your wounded pride does not interfere with our duties to Lord Wilfried. I am sure we can make use of the training grounds at my Master’s, I mean your grandfather’s estate. If you would send an ordonnanz to make the request and not delay us any further?”</p><p>He gritted his teeth at being practically ordered to contact his grandfather, but as Rozemyne did not have a schtappe yet, there was no helping the situation. He was tempted to make a point of commenting how inconvenient it must be for a knight to not be able to contact others with an ordonnanz or send rott. But in the end he decided it was not worth the effort. It would just inflame his temper even more. So he conceded to the <em> order </em>, and sent the ordonnanz. Requesting the usage of his grandfather's training yard for their duel.</p><p>After the reply arrived, confirming that they were welcome to make use of the training grounds the next day at fifth bell, he begrudgingly walked the girl through the instructions he needed to give her as fast as possible, and left to inform the rest of his family of the upcoming events. Seeing her superior looking smile was getting on his nerves.</p><p>“Welcome home, Lord Lamprecht.”</p><p>His attendant greeted him at the mansion when he arrived.</p><p>“Ah yes, I have returned. Is my father here yet?”</p><p>“Yes, milord, he is currently inside the greenhouse on the east side, along with your esteemed mother. Do you wish to join them, or would you like to change first?”</p><p>“No, I will meet with them directly.”</p><p>His attendant bowed at his answer, before guiding him in the direction of the gardens. It did not take that long before he arrived, only to find his parents enjoying some tea and snack together among the greenery. The sight struck him as unusual, Father and Mother were never that close before, what had changed? He was taken out of his musings as his mother greeted him. </p><p>“Lamprecht, welcome home.” </p><p>“Father, Mother, I have something to discuss with you. You see-”</p><p>His mother chastised him immediately before he could elaborate any further.</p><p>“Is it such a serious matter that you cannot even return greetings as proper?”</p><p>“My apologies, I would like to inform you of some, ehm, new developments, before grandfather takes the opportunity from me, if he hasn’t already done so.”</p><p>Both of his parents exchanged looks before looking at him expectantly, the slight frown on his mothers lips did not fill him with confidence, to his relief his father spoke up instead.</p><p>“Very well, go ahead, my son.”</p><p>“Well, Rozemyne joined us for her first day as Lord Wilfried’s knight today, and after some… disagreements, I may have-”</p><p>He was rudely interrupted for a <em> second time </em> as his grandfather landed with his highbeast directly before them in their garden! His loud voice was heard even through the thick glass panels of the greenhouse. </p><p>“MY GRANDSON AND MY DISCIPLE ARE HAVING A DUEL!!!” </p><p>The loud shout in his grandfather’s voice caused him to freeze up. His father merely sent him a dry look, his opinion on the matter as clear to him as to what Ewigeliebe wanted. He wilted slightly at the glare his mother was now throwing in his direction.</p><p>“I was just ab-”</p><p>“Karsted! My disciple got her first duel challenge! You have to be there for their match tomorrow! You too, Elvira!”</p><p>Was he cursed to never complete a sentence? This was the third time now. He chose to remain silent before someone could interrupt him <em> again </em>.</p><p>“Father in law, please speak in longer sentences. What happened?”</p><p>“Lamprecht challenged little Rozemyne to a duel! It is tomorrow at fifth bell at my estate, you <em> must </em> come and watch! The way my disciple fights is simply incredible!”</p><p>Why was his grandfather gushing about Rozemyne again instead of showing him some sort of support, was he not his grandson?</p><p>“...Lamprecht, dear, why don’t you finish what you were trying to tell us earlier?”</p><p>A cold shiver erupted on his back, his mother was now not just glaring at him but she had <em> that </em> smile on her face. He just wanted to run and hide now. He gathered every last ounce of fortitude before starting his explanation anew.</p><p>“...I may have challenged Rozemyne to a duel after she manipulated Lord Wilfried and insulted me…”</p><p>“This is going to be great!”</p><p>At least he finished his sentence this time before his grandfather began to shout again. Conveying any more of the details became rather difficult with him present, however, so he decided to fill his parents in during dinner, and focused his efforts on convincing his grandfather to <em> leave </em> before then.</p><p>The next day, as fifth bell rang, he finished his duties as expected of him, bid his farewell to his charge, and took out his highbeast, he would wait for Rozemyne at the training ground to show off the difference between their status even before the duel began. His grandfather was already waiting, of course, way too full of energy. His father was nearby too, not being able to escape from his grandfather’s insistence. He couldn’t see his mother at first, and was about to ask if she decided not to watch him humiliate a little girl, when he noticed her sitting in the shade in the distance, barely noticeable. She wasn’t alone either, and with a slight enhancement of his sight – surely not… Why would he of all people…</p><p>“My apologies for the delay, I had to change into a more appropriate choice of clothing for the occasion.”</p><p>He turned around upon hearing his opponent's bell-like voice. As he looked at Rozemyne he was very surprised at what he saw. She had forgone any kind of training outfit and wore a slightly modified light armor set, normally worn by knights. The skirt part was cut slightly in length, reaching just below her knees, an appropriate choice considering her age. And she was currently lacking any sort of cape, which again was understandable. As a weapon she was wielding a halberd of appropriate length for her height. It was still strange to look at such a young girl wearing the uniform normally worn by knights, he could not suppress giving her a mocking grin, which evoked no reaction, much to his disappointment.</p><p>“Never mind that, my disciple. With your arrival we can finally begin this slaug- I mean this duel. Are both of you ready?”</p><p>His Grandfather’s near slip of the tongue did nothing to brighten his mood. He was aware that he thought his prized disciple would trump him effortlessly, but he would prove him wrong. Sheer talent could not stand against experience, and she had only begun learning to fight less than a year ago.</p><p>“Of course, Master. Lamprecht I do not mind if you use your schtappe, let us both honor Angriff in this dance, don’t you agree?”</p><p>He was hard pressed not to scowl at the young girl’s blatant disregard of his skill. Wielding a schtappe weapon against a mere training weapon? He consoled himself that she would soon learn the error of her arrogance after her defeat.</p><p>“...If that is your wish I agree, let Angriff guide our actions instead of Grammaratur.”</p><p>He summoned his schtappe and transformed it into his preferred weapon.</p><p>“Schwert.”</p><p>His trusty longsword in hand he shifted into his combat stance. And watched as his opponent shifted her own into a more relaxed stance too, her weapon held in her right hand, the tip of the weapon just slightly above the ground. As open as the sight appeared he noticed minor shifts in her footing as he shifted his body weight on his left foot, it was a combat stance indeed. His father raised his hand to begin their duel.</p><p>“Ready, begin!”</p><p>As soon as the signal was given he charged at his opponent, his enhancement magic allowing him to cross the distance between them in short order. As he reached the striking distance of his weapon he swung at her torso to finish this fight quickly, she had not even raised her weapon to stop his advance or even moved. This would be over quicker than expected. His cheer was short lived as Rozemyne shifted her footing in the last moment, the action caused her body to narrowly evade his strike. As he prepared himself for the inevitable counter attack he was surprised that the girl merely took two steps to the left, giving him time to readjust his own stance to strike again.</p><p>He tried a series of thrusts at her center and legs next, but it was frustrating to watch as she evaded each of them with apparent ease. As he attempted another side swing he was forced to retreat as her weapon finally moved, the sharp blade of the halberd barely missing his neck! Momentarily shocked at this brutal counter he risked a look in her eyes and found only cold detachment looking back at him. The sight of her just… looking at him with those cold eyes, as if he was not worthy of even the slightest hint of concern made his anger erupt not unlike Elpberg. He would wipe that look off her face, even if it was the last thing he did!</p><p>He was caught off guard as Rozemyne finally made a move to attack herself, it took her surprisingly few steps to get her weapon into range for a thrust at his left leg. As he shifted his own weapon to counter the move midway, she shifted the angle of her weapon to catch his blade in the axe part of the halberd. He didn’t have a moment to adjust as she rotated the weapon further causing his blade to follow the movement, now being aimed to the ground at his left. The sudden shift caused him to lose his balance as he stumbled in her direction, and before he could adjust himself he felt like Vulcanift himself had struck a blow into his chest.</p><p>The sheer force of the blow caused his vision to swim slightly and robbed him of his breath, dark edges in vision appeared and pain made itself known not only in his chest but on his back too. It took him a moment to regain his senses to notice he was looking at the sky now, and the pain in his chest was lessening slightly into a dull ache. It took him another moment to stand up again, before searching for his opponent. Rozemyne was a few paces away, not even looking in his direction as she addressed their audience instead!</p><p>“I believe that is enough to close the matter right? I do not want to harm Lamprecht any further than this.”</p><p>In his anger at her declaration he nearly missed his Grandfather’s response.</p><p>“That simply will not do my disciple, take this duel more seriously!”</p><p>They are both disregarding him just like that?! Hearing this caused him to lose some of his composure.</p><p>“I- am not done! I will not be defeated by a little former temple flower!”</p><p>“...former temple flower?”</p><p>His sudden anger froze as if Schneeahst had suddenly decided to announce his presence. The look in Rozemyne’s eyes had shifted slightly, gone was the cold disregard of his presence. Now it felt more like his whole existence would be snuffed out if he dared to speak another word! He could not suppress a shiver at the suddenly ice cold feeling on his back.</p><p>“No wait I-”</p><p>“It seems there is some misunderstanding about my upbringing in the temple, do not worry, Lamprecht. It will be my pleasure to <em> reeducate </em> you about your <em> misconceptions. </em>”</p><p>He watched as she simply raised her free hand before speaking again.</p><p>“O’ Schutzaria, Goddess of Wind, I offer you my prayers. Grant my left hand the power to cut anything I desire.”</p><p>She spoke some sort of prayer? He blinked and she was gone. As he blinked again she was suddenly before him, and before he could react she swung her free hand from right to left, a trail of blood following its wake, causing him to become slightly confused. He had no moment to further grasp what was happening as he began to choke, a searing pain erupting in his neck. He fell to his knees and watched in horror as red droplets poured on the ground in startling quantities. He tried to use his left hand to stem the tide, but it was becoming painfully difficult to get any further air. Rozemyne had cut his throat with her bare hand, causing him to drown in his own blood!?</p><p>“O’ Flutrane, Goddess of Water and Heilschmerz, Goddess of Healing who serves by her side, I offer you my prayers. Please hear my plea and grant your divine healing and your cleaning waters to Lamprecht.” </p><p>The pain vanished but he was still drowning, to his immense relief it was quickly gone too and he desperately gulped the air he was formerly deprived of. He stood up and tried to regain his bearings when his right side exploded in searing pain. As he tried to focus on what was happening he became aware he was on the ground again. A quick look at the source of his agony revealed that his right arm was bent unnaturally, being broken slightly above his elbow. With his right arm out of commission he tried to stand up using his other arm to heave himself off the ground. But before he could do anything more than place his hand on the ground he cried out in pain as he felt something stab into his left hand before being robbed of air again as <em> another </em>strike into his chest caused those dreaded black edges to appear in his vision again.</p><p>Before he could gather what was happening he felt a weight on his throat, robbing him of nearly any air to fill his lungs <em> again </em>, tears gathering in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>“How does it feel being subjected to three of the divine blessings, Lamprecht?”</p><p>He looked up into those glowing, golden eyes. Now focused on him, instead of disregarding his presence. If this was the alternative he preferred the previous disregard! He averted his look from those frightening eyes to assess his current situation. Rozemyne had stabbed the spear part of her halberd through his left hand, stabbing it to the ground. Her right hand held the pole in a firm grip, making any chance of dislodging it quickly seem impossible. But that was not the most worrying part. She had placed her left foot on his throat and made her displeasure of his lacking attention known, choking him of his remaining air as she applied more pressure on his neck. As he shifted his vision back onto her face she spoke again, her voice a silent whisper.</p><p>“Pray to the Gods that you may never be forced to witness it again, Lamprecht. After all-”</p><p>The small smile on her lips made him shudder in fright.</p><p>“The thorns of Efflorelume can cut deeper than any blade made of wind. Be glad I never served in any…role of your description. Also, never-”</p><p>She leaned slightly closer, putting more pressure on his wound and throat. He would swear her eyes were glowing brighter in the shadow on her face too!</p><p>“Dare to call me a temple flower – former or otherwise – again. Understood?”</p><p>He did his best to nod at her, difficult as it was in his current position. Anything to get those eyes to stop looking at him like that! He did not even mind that he was nearly out of air, as long as she stopped to look at him as if he was mere prey to be slaughtered!?</p><p>“Good. Oh by the way Lamprecht, did you know people have the tendency to reveal their true thoughts in different states of mind? Like under the influence of Vantole, or high amounts of anger or stress. Do you know there is another state of mind where they reveal their true self?”</p><p>He shook his head as much as he was able to. His distress only grew as the most frightening grin bloomed on Rozemyne’s face!</p><p>“It's when someone experiences true terror, or the state of being afraid of something or someone to an unreasonable degree. Tell me, are you terrified of me now… <em> Lamprecht </em>?”</p><p>He could not even think clearly enough to refuse her questioning, so he simply nodded his head.</p><p>“...A shame, I had such high hopes from the grandson of my Master. Please be assured that I will treat you with every ounce of respect you <em> deserve</em>. If you prove your worth to me I will be glad to serve alongside you in Lord Wilfrieds entourage, but if you disappoint my expectations again…”</p><p>The open threat, combined with an increase of pressure on his sore throat, and lack of air nearly caused him to whimper.</p><p>“I guess we will see how Dregaruhr spins.” </p><p>With that she removed her foot from his sore neck and pulled her halberd out of his abused hand in a graceful motion, before departing from his vision. He could do nothing but try to take huge gulps of air.  </p><p>“O’ Heilschmerz, Goddess of Healing, hear my prayer and grant your blessing to Lamprecht.”</p><p>The pain in his left hand and chest vanished and his right arm became slightly numb. As he took another moment to regain his senses he got up shakily. Seeing his family looking at him in open concern. Well all of them except his grandfather, of course.</p><p>“How disappointing. To hear my own grandson speak such slander against my own disciple… Karstedt, what by the seven are you teaching in the Order these days? Even if Rozemyne is my disciple she should have to at least get serious when facing my grandson… and his choice of words…”</p><p>“Father… Are you not too cruel to Lamprecht? Look at what she did to him!”</p><p>He looked on as Bonifatius regarded his father with a frown on his face.</p><p>“Did to him? I see. If that is what you think of this duel I guess it is time to show her a lesson, don’t you think so?”</p><p>“P-Pardon me?”</p><p>“Do I have to spell it out for you, Karstedt? Fight Rozemyne, right now. After you defeat her you are free to voice your criticism of her treatment of her opponents in battle.”</p><p>It made him feel slightly better to watch as his father was looking at his grandfather slightly uncomfortably now.</p><p>“That- I mean it would be unfair for her to face the knight commander in battle, just after a duel. Maybe we should revisit the point after she has recovered?”</p><p>“Do not worry yourself, my son. This fight was not enough to trouble my disciple, as sad as it is to say that about my own grandson, am I right Rozemyne?</p><p>“Of course, Master. It would be an honor to face our revered Knight commander in the dance of Angriff.”</p><p>And so Lamprecht watched on as his father reluctantly took the position he was previously in, opposite the frightening terror who had humiliated him previously. It would take a while to forget those eyes. Just thinking about them caused him to shiver again. He could not wait to see his beloved Aurelia to simply bask in her presence and affection.</p><p>“Ready, begin!”</p><p>He shook his head slightly to focus on the duel now taking place before him. This time Rozemyne chose to take a more offensive route, even if he was not able to follow her movements. She was simply too fast for him to follow. Apparently his father had similar problems as he now sported a large cut on his face. The sheer difference in combat experience was showing though as he managed to hold on in the face of Rozemynes relentless assault. </p><p>As if to further crumble his self esteem by making his prediction incorrect his father received a devastating strike to his leg, causing him to roll to the side in a desperate attempt to escape his foe.</p><p>The midnight haired terror was a step faster though as she kicked his fathers head in a whirling kick that made him wince just from watching. Before Karstedt could recover her halberd had impaled his father’s left leg! Just as he pulled the weapon out of his appendage he was kicked into his chest with such force he was ragdolling before being stopped by a nearby wall. Just seeing the unfolding events made one thing clear to him. He never stood any chance against Rozemyne. Ever. And everyone knew it beforehand. He should have simply let the case rest, it could also have avoided his fathers pummeling by a seven year old. He watched with detached fascination as Rozemyne kicked his father into the chest <em> again, </em> to the sky this time. As he saw his father falling he noticed the sheer force of her kick had <em> dented </em> his fathers armor, most likely making it hard to breath. He did not even want to think about possible injuries enduring this kind of force would have on his own body.</p><p>CRASH!</p><p>His father’s body impacted with the unforgiving ground, Rozemyne had retrieved her Halberd in the meantime and placed her weapon at Karstedt’s neck. Forcing him to resign, still gasping for air as he tried to remove his chestplate. </p><p>“Phew! That looked like it hurt. Poor Karsted…”</p><p>He whipped his head around at hearing Lord Sylvester’s voice from directly behind him. It seemed his eyes had not deceived him earlier, it was truly Aub Ehrenfest himself who was sitting with his mother. The scale of the repercussions of his failure nearly made him faint. The archduke even noticed him looking in his direction, and winked at him, raising his finger to his lips in a shushing motion! For the sake of his own sanity, he simply nodded, and focused his attention back to the place of his father’s defeat, trying very hard to forget even seeing Lord Sylvester at all.</p><p>At the very least Rozemyne was breathing heavily now, clearly out of breath. It was a small consolation for their family though, seeing a seven year old girl beating the best active knight of their duchy was terrifying to witness.</p><p>“What is this madness? She did not even need to sing! I guess the whole Order needs retraining…”</p><p>His grandfather's words caused everyone to look at him strangely. What had her singing to do with anything?</p>

    <h1>Roselinde - The challenges of Wiegenmilch</h1><p> </p><p>The sound of fighting was audible even from a distance. Roselinde was currently on her way to watch another sparring session between her daughter and dark god. Rozemyne had requested to increase the frequency of these lessons, quoting the necessity for it due to her new position. Both her and Guthfried had agreed with her reasoning, Guthfried with a great deal more enthusiasm than her, of course. </p><p>She didn’t have many opportunities to teach her beloved daughter anything recently. After the failure that was her meeting with Lady Veronica, she had to admit to herself that she was not as fluent in the dance of Grammaratur as she had wished to be. She blamed her harassment in ladies’ society for her atrophied skills, but to be honest it was never that much of her forte anyway. In contrast, her daughter seemed to have a natural affinity for it. It was honestly intimidating to watch the sheer gulf in skill between them. Following that, any further training lessons concerning tea parties were postponed indefinitely, much to her chagrin. Was she so lacking that she could not teach her genius daughter anything? She sighed.</p><p>She had finally become Wiegenmilch to at least one of her adorable daughters, the fact she was failing in her main duty to guide them into the start of their summer was weighing heavily on her still somewhat fractured heart. There had to be something she could teach Rozemyne, anything where she was still lacking and required her guidance. </p><p>As she arrived at the training grounds of their estate, she saw that her adorable daughter was currently locked in a high intensity fight with her father. She was no knight, but it seemed Guthfried was currently on the back foot, which only somewhat surprised her. Those training sessions with Lord Bonifatius certainly showed results, if nothing else. Even a practical stranger was teaching more to her little angel than her…</p><p>She watched as Rozemyne delivered a devastating kick into her father’s gut, sending him sprawling into a nearby tree, heralding the end of the match. She watched as they retook their positions after her daughter healed her father with a beautiful blessing. She would have never have expected to envy her dark god over anything, but here she was, craving more time with her daughter. She sighed again before silently making her way back into the estate, failing to register the worried look Mathilde sent her way.</p><p>On the next day, as she was receiving the usual report on Rozemyne’s progress, Mathilde made an offhand comment which gave her pause.</p><p>“Lady Roselinde, forgive me if I may be speaking out of turn, but do you not want to teach milady something too? You began isolating yourself again recently.”</p><p>“Really? I…”</p><p>Was she truly closing up that much? She had to find a way to spend more time with her daughter, but what excuse could she use? The need to prepare her for her future duties took precedent currently. All of them agreed to arm Rozemyne with any advantage they could. She needed all the tools she could to use as her armor against any possible danger she would potentially face. </p><p>Wait, that was it! Armor!</p><p>“...Mathilde. Did my daughter receive instruction in how to create any form of feystone armor until now? Anhaltung has kept her silence on this so far.”</p><p>Her trusted friend simply shook her head, seemingly confused by the abrupt change of topic.</p><p>“None that I remember, Lady Roselinde. Lord Guthfried has so far made no move to guide her in their creation, he was more concerned with teaching her to utilize her blessings from Angriff.”</p><p>She could not suppress the sly grin forming on her lips, causing Mathilde to raise one of her eyebrows.</p><p>“How truly sad. Why, I think it is a priority to teach my daughter the necessary skills immediately. And maybe…”</p><p>“Maybe?”</p><p>Roselinde chuckled. She may not be as advanced in Grammaratur’s dance anymore, but she could still plot something as innocent as this.</p><p>“Our plans for Rozemyne to take only the knight course to not draw too much attention to her abundant blessings failed spectacularly. There is no reason not to showcase her brilliance at the Royal Academy in the slightest anymore, correct? If that is the case, it would only be natural if I act as her Erwachlehren regarding the attendant course. Let us combine both lessons together. I can show her how to create her armor, while at the same time spending more time with her by teaching her attendant course material!”</p><p>Her plan was brilliant!</p><p>“My Lady, your true intentions are still leaking out when you are excited. I thought you had gotten rid of that bad habit years ago…”</p><p>She refused to get discouraged from Mathilde’s critique, so she decided to ignore her comments.</p><p>“I will inform Rozemyne of my wishes as soon as she is available. These matters are of the utmost importance!”</p><p>“… It is as you say Lady Roselinde. Truly, the matter is of grave significance.”</p><p>The exasperated smile on Mathilde's lips did nothing to dampen her happy mood. She now had an excuse to finally spend more time with her adorable daughter again, and teach her something to boot! It was perfect!?</p><p>After the usual family meal she decided to speak about the topic before they dispersed to their respective rooms.</p><p>“Dear Daughter, I would like to discuss something very important about your choice of course for the Royal Academy.”</p><p>She started. It was as good an excuse as any to get a chance to teach her daughter something she was good at.</p><p>“Was there more to discuss, Mother? Did we not decide I should take the knight course to not garner too much attention?”</p><p>“Yes, we did. But as you know, those efforts were not entirely… fruitful. Your talents have already been noticed by that Cha- the archducal family, and you are bound to serve Lord Wilfried. That is inevitable now. However, I do not wish you to bind your stars to someone because of politics, and the best way for you to get to pick whoever your heart bears a rafel for would be to showcase your abundant blessings from the gods at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>While her main goal was to get some alone time with her daughter where she could proudly teach her something, she wasn’t exactly lying about her wishes for her future. Her heart had bore a rafel for Guthfried and his bore one for her, and despite the many challenges they faced over the years their marriage had been the thing that kept her going. While marriages for love were rare among nobles, she wanted her daughter to have a loving relationship with her dark god like she had.</p><p>For her part, her daughter’s eyebrows raised very slightly – the only indication that she was surprised by what she had heard. She was visibly trying to show more emotion when she was with her family, they had all noticed, but it was still only small details and appeared to take her some effort. Another reminder of how her life in the temple had affected her. </p><p>After chewing on the words for a moment she spoke.</p><p>“You are right, Mother. Showing my talents at the academy would be the best course of action if I wish to find a match outside of the duchy.”</p><p>That was not exactly what she wanted to hear. She would have rather had her daughter be excited about being able to choose her own dark god. Nevertheless, she would not give up. She still had many years until she would be engaged to anyone, so she would make sure that her daughter chose someone worthy of her affection!</p><p>“It is good that you also see it that way. I think taking all three courses available to you would be the best way to show your excellence to others attending the academy with you. For that, you will need some practice with the other courses as well. You are already a proficient knight as both your father and Lord Bonifatius will tell anyone willing to listen, and your brewing ability is already better than anyone else in the estate. But you still lack some knowledge from the general classes that your father hasn’t had the opportunity to cover during your lessons yet. You also do not have any practice with the attendant course. I would like to take up the job of teaching you everything that your father has missed and the intricacies of being an attendant! Tuuliane can also join us for more training!”</p><p>She might have said the last part with a bit too much excitement in her voice. Guthfried was looking at her with an amused glint in his eyes, while Mathilde was shaking her head behind Rozemyne. Tuuliane looked excited at the prospect of being taught by her mother. Rozemyne herself wore a small grin showing that she was already onto the real reason Roselinde was volunteering to teach her. She, however, couldn’t care less about how obvious she was being with her true intentions with teaching her daughters. It was of utmost importance that they be taught properly! The potential to get her dignity back was just an extra benefit she would trade for exasperated looks from Mathilde any day of the week.</p><p>“But of course, Mother. Nothing would please me more than spending time with you and learning from you and dear Tuuliane.”</p><p>Rozemyne somehow managed to keep the smile that was still present on her face out of her voice.</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Tuuliane clasped her hands together in a pose so adorable that Roselinde almost squealed in delight. Her daughters were the most adorable children in the world!</p><p>On the day they agreed to hold their lessons, she made her way to her daughter's chambers. Apparently, she had the same idea as she just saw Rozemyne leaving her room. Her daughter was eager to spend more time with her too! She pulverized some feystones before catching Rozemyne’s attention and instructing her to follow.</p><p>“Where are we heading, Mother? I thought we would hold those lessons inside of your room?”</p><p>She had to suppress an excited giggle. Her daughter was not prepared for what she had in mind in the least.</p><p>“Almost correct, dear daughter of mine. We are heading to the biggest bath! That is, the bath in my chambers.”</p><p>“…Your bath?”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at her with slight confusion bleeding into her eyes. As usual, nothing could be read on her face, but she prided herself in being able to read her daughter's moods from her eyes alone at this point. It was her proof she was not failing in her role as Wiegenmilch completely. Her youngest chose to remain silent for the rest of the way, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the doors of their destination. After they entered her chambers, she led them to the door of her changing room. She turned around and began to address their current attendants.</p><p>“From this point on, it will be Rozemyne and me only. You may attend to other matters instead. Tuuliane will stay, of course.”</p><p>Her daughter looked at her questioningly, before agreeing and dismissing her own attendants except for her big sister. The three of them then entered the warm room containing a sink, a massage table and some comfortable seats for changing. The room also opened into a washroom, and a room with a large, slightly steaming, open pool of water, the door to which was already open to let the warmth heat into the changing room. As she closed the door to her chambers behind them, she finally decided to inform her daughters of her plans.</p><p>“My dear daughters, as previously discussed we will now begin our lesson. Let us forsake Grammaratur for now, it will only get in the way. Tuuliane already knows this, so it is best she shows you how to correctly undress a Lady you will possibly serve as an attendant.”</p><p>Her youngest daughter's eyes widened, making her look even more adorable than usual. Her oldest simply smiled impishly at her younger sister.</p><p>“Wait, you mean you will show me how to correctly strip someone?!”</p><p>“Slightly more crude than I would have worded it but not entirely incorrect, my adorable daughter. Still, there is a huge difference between ‘stripping’ someone and the proficiency expected from an attendant in clothing and unclothing their Lady. So try to watch closely when I remove the garments of your older sister. After that is done, I will then redress her. Afterwards it's your turn, Rozemyne. Also, do not forget – the ability to improvise under unideal circumstances to still fulfill your Lady’s wish when you can’t follow her orders exactly is what can raise you to a first-rate attendant from a second-rate one.”</p><p>Rozemyne was listening to her with rapt attention, making her heart soar at seeing her so attentive to her words.</p><p>“First-rate and second-rate attendant? What do you mean with that, Mother? What is the difference between them?”</p><p>She nodded at the astute question, before giving her answer.</p><p>“There are minute differences, but those come with experience. The most important difference is in understanding and anticipating your Lady’s desire beyond the words of their orders. It is well and good to simply do what you are ordered to do as an attendant, but if you do not immediately understand what desires those orders convey, you would be only a third-rate attendant. A second-rate attendant is still merely doing what their master or mistress orders, but they can also understand the exact will behind the orders. Meanwhile, a first class attendant does not even need to receive an order, but can anticipate the desires and thoughts of their master or mistress, and act accordingly to fulfill them. And before you ask, I was first class once under Lady Constanze, but after so long without serving anyone I think I would be second class at best currently. Any more questions?”</p><p>Her youngest appeared to think for a moment before shaking her head gently.</p><p>“Not for now, no.”</p><p>“Good, now watch my movements. Tuuliane, my dear, please turn around.”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>“Understood, Lady Roselinde.”</p><p>She decided being addressed like that in private by her own daughter would not do at all.</p><p>“You may address me as Mother or Mom too, Tuuliane. We are alone here after all.”</p><p>“I can? Thank you, Mom!”</p><p>The quick reply warmed her heart. She then moved behind her oldest daughter and began to demonstrate every step to her youngest, who was watching very carefully. When Tuuliane was just in her bloomers and chemise, she turned to Rozemyne.</p><p>“Do you have any questions so far?”</p><p>She simply shook her head in answer.</p><p>“Good, then now to the dressing part.”</p><p>When Tuuliane was fully clothed again, it was time for Rozemyne to try, so Roselinde stepped aside before guiding her to stand behind her older sister.</p><p>“Now it's your turn, Rozemyne. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Remember to be mindful of her hair.”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>Her youngest daughter was moving with elegant, but still somewhat awkward movements. It was to be expected for the first time undressing someone, still it was not bad at all for the first time. The fact it was her own sister seemed to greatly help in the matter. She still remembered her first time at those lessons with a total stranger – it was so awkward at first. It seemed her youngest was gaining confidence though, as the dressing of Tuuliane was flowing much smoother. Not nearly at a level one would expect from an attendant, but not bad at all.</p><p>“Well done, Rozemyne. Tuuliane, did you already learn how to work on someone who is already grown up?”</p><p>Her oldest turned back around to look at her before shaking her head.</p><p>“No, I only learned how to do my duties to serve my sister until now. Lady Mathilde was planning to teach me in a few years about the topic, not now.”</p><p>“Well, there is a difference depending on the build of your and your Lady’s body, so she is correct to wait with those lessons for a few years at least. Nobody would expect someone early in their summer to perform these duties for a Lady even entering autumn, not to mention well into it, anyway.”</p><p>She looked at her daughters, who nodded their heads in agreement.</p><p>“Now, as you know, Rozemyne, the clothes we wear are not made to be taken off without an attendant, as even the lowest laynoble would have either a family member or a servant attending to them. It is only the servants who wear clothes that button and tie at the front so they can dress themselves. However, as you are also training as a knight, you could use the knowledge you gain as an attendant to learn to undress without any aid, in case of unpredictable circumstances.”</p><p>Her youngest blinked at her. It was the most expressive she had seen her in days.</p><p>“I could? Huh…”</p><p>“Indeed. My own dress is too elaborate for an example, so I would not try to remove it myself even if I was still an attendant. But by watching how it is removed, you can learn the steps that need to be taken if you were wearing something similar. Tuuliane, be a dear and follow my instructions. I need to be in my undergarments to show you some of the rest of the lesson, but I will ask you to help me dress again when we are done.”</p><p>Tuuliane helped her out of her clothes with only slight problems, most of them due to their height difference. So, after getting out of her clothes, she turned around and looked at Rozemyne to instruct her to practice on her older sister again. Before she could voice anything, she had to blink at the expression on her daughters’ faces.</p><p>Tuuliane was staring at her subtly, thanks to her training no doubt, but the biggest surprise was Rozemyne. Her youngest daughter was switching between looking below Roselinde’s head and her own not yet developed chest with an expression on her face resembling… <em> envy</em>? Was- Was her adorable daughter envious about her blessings from Geduldh? Well, Guthfried had called her abundantly blessed by Geduldh before – in privacy of course – and she had to admit she was better off in this regard than some others. But to see her young daughter feeling insecure about her own body would not do!</p><p>“Do not worry, Rozemyne, I am sure you will receive your blessings from Geduldh soon enough.”</p><p>“Eep!”</p><p>Her darling daughter let out a cute little noise as she clutched her chest protectively! She was looking mortified at her now, her face being the most expressive she had ever seen.</p><p>“I- It's not that! I just- just…”</p><p>Roselinde decided to save her daughter from her embarrassment by changing the topic.</p><p>“Rozemyne, you won’t be able to learn the next lesson if your sister is fully clothed. My dear Tuuliane, I hope you do not mind?”</p><p>“Not at all, Mom.”</p><p>Her oldest daughter seemingly snapped out of her funk and looked at her with a warm smile before turning around again so Rozemyne could begin to undress her. Roselinde watched the process with a critical eye. Rozemyne was still struggling to retain her graceful movements when undressing her sister. When she was about to stop as Tuuliane was still wearing her undergarments, she urged her to continue.</p><p>“Do finish unclothing her, my Daughter. We will speak about how to thoroughly clean your Lady next.”</p><p>Rozemyne sent an unreadable glance in her direction before simply nodding as she continued to undress her sister until she was fully exposed.</p><p>“Tuuliane, go soak in the bath a little bit so I can demonstrate how to clean someone for your sister. I’m sorry it won’t be a very long soak, I’ll just explain the steps and then call you when we are ready.”</p><p>“Okay, Mom!”</p><p>Roselinde sighed happily as she watched her oldest nearly skip towards the bath. If the excuse for today wasn’t to teach Rozemyne some skills, she would have pampered Tuuliane to her heart’s delight. Perhaps another time…</p><p>She turned back towards Rozemyne, and explained the various steps to washing and massaging a lady after a bath – including the various soaps and oils they used, the correct way to hold a brush, and how to make sure one was not applying too much pressure. They would not be covering massages today, as that alone would take multiple days, but it was good to mention the basics nonetheless.</p><p>Once they were ready, Roselinde picked up the necessary cleaning utensil before presenting them to her youngest and calling for Tuuliane to get out of the bath. She was surprised as Rozemyne showed remarkable skill in washing someone under her guidance, especially the hair. Upon questioning her, she simply responded that it felt more awkward for her to ‘strip’ and clothe someone. Also, she felt comfortable with Tuuliane, as she was her own sister. It made sense, so she dismissed it from her mind. </p><p>While she walked around her daughters to correct and advise Rozemyne she subtly inspected her oldest. As far as she could tell, Tuuliane seemed to take more after herself, if her faint memories of her own growth were accurate. Roselinde had been a late bloomer too. Only beginning to grow into her womanly figure after the first year of the Royal Academy. Tuuliane was still growing out of her spring days, just beginning to reach into her summer. When her oldest daughter was cleaned, she addressed them both again.</p><p>“Well done, Rozemyne. You will require more training in refining your movements and you will need to lose the hesitation, but it was very good for a first try. Now, redress your sister, and it is Tuuliane’s turn.”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>When Tuuliane was fully clothed again, she watched the skill of her oldest with a critical eye. Mathilde had trained her well – her movements were refined and graceful, the routine she had in serving her younger sister shining through. Rozemyne also got a speedy soak in the bath before getting washed by her sister. She stepped closer when Tulliane had finished. She began to inspect her other cute little angel just as she had done with Tuuliane earlier, but also to assess her eldest’s work. In contrast to her sister, Rozemyne seemed to be an early bloomer. She was at the same height as her older sister, if not even a little bit taller. She did not know if it was a result of the knight training, but her figure appeared leaner than her sister’s in comparison. She was surprised that she was even showing the first sign of Geduldh’s favor, perhaps that was why she had reacted to her own blessing earlier? She was taken out of her thoughts when Tuuliane spoke to her sister, an adorable pout on her face!</p><p>“I do not know what you are so envious about, Sister. If anything, Geduldh already seems to favor you more! People could even confuse you for being the older sibling. It’s so unfair…”</p><p>“I am sorry, Sister. You are still the best sister one could ask for. I am sure Anwachs will grant you his blessing soon as well.”</p><p>She coughed to get their attention again. It was time for the last lesson she told Rozemyne about: how to apply and wear a feystone bodysuit and armor respectively.</p><p>She got to her discarded dress and took the necessary stones and single tool out of her bags before presenting them to her little darlings.</p><p>“These are feystones used to create a bodysuit and a tool to create the full armor. Normally you would learn what I am about to teach you in the Royal Academy, but seeing as you got pulled into the machinations of Veronica earlier than we feared, you need to learn to use them now, Rozemyne. I have another stone if you want to try creating your own bodysuit as well, Tuuliane.”</p><p>She passed the stones to her eager looking children before holding up her own personal stone. </p><p>“You need to channel your mana to dye the stone first. It will take more effort for you, Tuuliane, as you have a smaller capacity, so do not be discouraged. After you have dyed the stone, you begin creating your bodysuit as you apply it onto your body, like this.” </p><p>She demonstrated the process to her girls before dismissing it shortly after it formed. As expected, it took Rozemyne no time at all to dye the feystone, which was now painted in the divine color of Leidenschaft. She began to guide her daughter how to create and apply the suit again. It took her surprisingly little effort to finish the steps, so after confirming her other daughter was still concentrating on dyeing her stone she presented the tool to her youngest.</p><p>“This tool forms into a gauntlet when you dye it with your mana. When you wear it, it will adjust in size to fit you perfectly. I honestly have no experience with it, so it would be best to ask your father about it for more details. The empty spot is where you can place your highbeast stone. I am sorry, but this armor is the best we could acquire on short notice, so it would be best if you create a new one later from better materials.”</p><p>Her youngest gave her an affectionate hug, which she returned as a matter of course.</p><p>“Thank you, Mom! I think I will wait with the full armor until I have spoken with dad. Do you think-”</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>Both of them looked at Tuuliane who was holding her own dyed blue stone proudly above her head. She exchanged an amused look with Rozemyne before walking closer to her oldest to help her in creating her bodysuit. Sadly, she was not able to form it in the slightest, much to her devastation.</p><p>“Do not worry, it is taught in the academy for a reason, Tuuliane.”</p><p>“But Rozemyne finished it before I even dyed my own stone. How can I hold onto my pride as the big sister when my little sister beats me at everything?”</p><p>She had honestly no idea how to answer that question. She had no idea Tuuliane was fighting with feelings of inadequacy by comparing herself to her little sister.</p><p>“A Lady does not confess to her own weaknesses, lest she be exploited. Did you forget Mathilde’s lessons already, Tuuliane?”</p><p>“How mean!”</p><p>Her oldest seemingly forgot about her depression upon hearing her little sister's words. She threw a thankful look at Rozemyne as she watched the both of them begin to wrangle in a playfight. Of course Rozemyne held back, but seeing her two angels getting along so easily was still heartwarming.</p><p>She chuckled before putting an end to the argument, as amusing as it was to watch them they had to redress again, now that the lessons were finished.</p><p>“Tuuliane, redress your sister. When you are finished, I will guide you to help me back into my dress.”</p><p>“Okay, Mom.” </p><p>When all of them wore their original clothes again, she lifted Rozemyne up from the ground and into her arms, where she rested her head seemingly unconsciously on top of the pillows Geduldh blessed her with as she adjusted her own grip on her little darling. The fact that her youngest was trying to hide her obvious comfort as she further buried her little head in Roselinde’s chest was, simply speaking, adorable! She could not help herself but stroke her youngest daughter’s head affectionately as she indicated her oldest to follow her back into the main room of her chambers and into her hidden room. She sat down into a big pile of soft pillows she used recently to rest more comfortably when she shared affectionate gestures with her adorable daughters.</p><p>“Is this some new form of punishing me? Why is only my sister getting all of the affection?”</p><p>Tuuliane’s sudden comment brought her out of her trance-like state. She looked at her oldest daughter exasperatedly before guiding her to rest her head on her remaining pillow from Geduldh. Both of her young daughters now clung to her body in search of affection and comfort only their Wiegenmilch could provide. It was as if all of her dreams had become true! Even if her oldest was not openly her daughter, all of them currently resting on the comfortable pile, while her two darlings clung to her for affection was pure bliss! Guthfried would be so jealous when she told him about it later!</p><p>She nearly lost to temptation and asked if Rozemyne could sing them a song, but she refrained. Instead she began to stroke Tuuliane’s head as well. The reaction was nearly the same, as her oldest began to melt like putty into her arms. Both of her daughters now pressed into her body as their heads rested on her chest. She simply decided to enjoy this moment of unconditional love and affection as she closed her eyes, a peaceful smile on her face. It was so good to be given the chance to become Wiegenmilch.</p><p> </p><h1>Lieseleta - Anhaltung's blessings' many forms</h1><p> </p><p>The anxiety she felt only continued to grow as she followed Lady Rozemyne, Tuuliane and her sister out of the playroom. The walk to the adjacent room was done in silence. When they arrived, she was the last one to enter, so she closed the door behind her.</p><p>“Before we begin, let us reinforce Verbergen’s protection.”</p><p>She watched as Tuuliane took out an area-wide sound blocking tool before beginning to place the parts around them. It was most likely Lady Rozemyne’s, but it seemed she was already trusted enough to be put in charge of such an expensive tool. She chose not to interfere for now, her sister had been told what to say initially multiple times. So she remained silent as the blue barrier appeared around them.</p><p>‘Does she always carry the tool with her?’</p><p>“Now, what did you want to speak about, Angelica?”</p><p>“Ah, can we forsake Grammaratur for now, Lady Rozemyne? I was told it would make things easier.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne looked at her sister with a slightly raised eyebrow before giving her consent.</p><p>“Very well. So, what is it you want from me?”</p><p>Angelica kneeled before Lady Rozemyne, who remained unperturbed, the only indicator of surprise was her eyebrow rising slightly higher.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, It may appear sudden, but please, hear my plea. I speak from my heart when I say I wish for nothing more than to serve as your sword and shield! Please, grant me the honor to serve you as Angriff, allow me to become a knight under your service!”</p><p>“Um, Angelica, you may not know this, but that is not possible.”</p><p>Of course Lady Rozemyne would answer that way, it was expected. As far as Lieseleta was aware, the younger lady was not informed of her insane sister’s ambitions beforehand. Lieseleta’s anxiousness calmed slightly when she noticed Lady Rozemyne threw a glance in her direction, seemingly concerned, before looking at Angelica again.</p><p>“I am an archnoble, knights may only serve our honored Archducal family, or a Giebe. I am sorry.”</p><p>Lieseleta took a subtle breath. This was as far as their instructions for the meeting went. From now on, it was up to Angelica to convey her feelings to Lady Rozemyne. She just hoped her beloved big sister would not lose her unreliable blessings from Grammaratur.</p><p>“I know that already, Lady Rozemyne. Which is why I decided on another way, one shown to me by your Father, Lord Guthfried himself.”</p><p>Angelica assumed a begging pose.</p><p>“Please give me the opportunity to swear my name to you, Lady Rozemyne. I long for nothing more than to enter your service. I am more than willing to create a namestone and present it to you, to show my absolute loyalty.”</p><p>After her sister had finished her insane plea, she focused on Lady Rozemyne intensively, trying to analyze her reaction to her sister’s ambitions.</p><p>“I- you want to wha-?”</p><p>To her surprise, it was Lady Rozemyne who lost the blessing of Grammaratur first. <em> Curious. </em> So far the younger girl had appeared unshakable, but who was offered the name of an older girl just after her baptism anyway? She could not really fault her for the sudden loss of composure. </p><p>“Do you even know what those words mean, Angelica? Are you aware of what you are asking?”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I swear to become your sword and shield, your personal knight. It is a knight’s duty to place their charge’s safety above all else, and follow them to the heights if they fail. Lord Guthfried told me of the ramifications, and the fact you may order me to do whatever you desire. Him and my own family informed me of the possible consequences in great detail until I understood. I do not mind them. Please allow me to present my name to you, my Lady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne took a few moments before speaking again. She seemed deep in thought, Lieseleta’s concern about her sister spiked as the younger girl appeared… annoyed now? She changed her expression into a stern frown, which made Lieseleta tense up. Had they insulted her unknowingly?</p><p>“You would swear your name to me… knowing I could order you to do whatever I wish for?”</p><p>Her older sister did not even hesitate in giving her answer.</p><p>“Yes, my Lady. I do.”</p><p>The frown on Lady Rozemyne’s face grew more profound. When she spoke again her voice had lost any semblance of warmth as she looked at Angelica with intense focus.</p><p>“…and if I ordered you to kill your own family? Your sister Lieseleta, for example.”</p><p>Lieseleta looked at the younger girl in shock, those cold words she spoke made her own blood freeze in her veins. She looked between her sister and Lady Rozemyne with fear in her heart, clutching her hands together as the silence continued to stretch. Would her older sister be willing to kill her to fulfill her ambition to serve her chosen mistress? She desperately hoped the answer was no, but ever since they sparred, her older sister was becoming obsessed with Lady Rozemyne. Would she kill her own sister for it if that was the demanded price? Why kill her anyway, was it a test of loyalty? Did she offend Lady Rozemyne somehow? As her panic grew, her sister’s reply cut through the silence like her mana weapon through air.</p><p>“I would protect you with my life from them, my Lady, but I don’t think they could harm you. They are attendants, not knights.”</p><p>Of course, leave it to her older sister to misunderstand even such a straightforward question. The frown on Lady Rozemynes face became slightly scary to look at now.</p><p>“That was not my question, Angelica, so I will repeat myself. Can you kill your own family if I demand it?”</p><p>“I do not think you would ever order me to do that, my Lady.”</p><p>Her sister’s stalling did not ease the growing panic in her heart. She had still not given a clear answer, and the growing anger in Lady Rozemyne’s expression was beginning to ignite fear for her life.</p><p>“How would you know what I would or wouldn’t ask for? You have not known me nearly long enough. Do not further procrastinate Angelica, answer the question.”</p><p>“But… I do know, my Lady. I know when there is danger nearby. I know when a feybeast will attack and when it will run. I know when I need to move to block and attack. And I know you would never order me to kill my family.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne began to unleash the reins on her mana in her anger at her older sister’s obliviousness. Lieseleta tried to remain upright, but it felt as if any warmth was sucked out of her. She tried to look away, but her body did not heed her orders. Lieseleta could only look at Lady Rozemyne as the cold crushing force of her mana made her tremble in fright. At this rate Lady Rozemyne was going to kill both of them herself!</p><p>“You are obviously too nai-”</p><p>Before Lady Rozemyne could finish her judgment, her suicidal sister dared to interrupt the angered archnoble before them! Lieseleta could not even stop her as the cold feeling made it impossible for her to move, or even speak!?</p><p>“I know I don’t understand many things… I can see I trouble my sister a lot. But… In here… I feel it would hurt you even more than me to give me that kind of order, my Lady.”</p><p>She watched in fright as Lady Rozemyne’s eyes widened slightly, the biggest show of surprise on her face today.</p><p>“I don’t understand what that means. But as we crossed blades, I felt a connection.”</p><p>Her older sister leaned slightly forward before continuing her sentence.</p><p>“My instincts tell me you are a kind-hearted person, Lady Rozemyne. I trust you with my life and my name. I am sure you would never willingly lead me astray. I know I am a failure as a noble and as a lady.”</p><p>Angelica took a deep breath after confessing her shortcomings.</p><p>“No other master would accept a failure such as me serving them. But you spar with me and excuse my language. I feel me and my family would both be safer with my name in your hands than any other future I could imagine.”</p><p>She lowered her head and crossed her hands before Lady Rozemyne in a perfect subordinate pose.</p><p>“So I beg you, my lady. Please allow me to swear my name to you.”</p><p>She watched with dread as Lady Rozemyne froze slightly. Her eyes started to gain a faraway look, the cold feeling vanishing instantly, making Lieseleta sigh in relief. She took a deep breath of air, not even having realized she was holding her breath before.</p><p>Pain. It came so suddenly, Lieseleta barely registered it for what it was before she fell to her knees. It felt as if her whole body was being crushed, but how? Why?! If the previous show of the richness of Lady Rozemyne’s mana was already frightening before, it paled in comparison to this new level they were exposed to now. It became hard to breathe, the invisible force of the young archnoble’s mana crushing everyone in the room. She risked a look at Tuuliane. The young laynoble was on her knees as well, desperately gasping for air as Lady Rozemyne continued to crush all of them without any conscious effort! She was not even looking at them!? Instead she was staring at her own hands with a curious mixture of horror, resignation and despair? She was even openly crying! What by the Supreme Couple was happening?! </p><p>Her older sister was the only one able to move. She crawled to her chosen mistress, taking her shaking hands into her own, before nearly shouting at her.</p><p>“My Lady!”</p><p>The pain and feeling of being crushed vanished as abruptly as it appeared. She was again forced to take as much air back into her lungs as possible. As Lieseleta began to shakily stand up she heard her beloved older sister speak again.</p><p>“This must be what my instincts tried to tell me. I don’t have the right words to offer comfort. But I recognise the feeling.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne stared at Angelica intensively, tears still flowing from her golden eyes. </p><p>“It’s like when I have so many feelings and confusion under the surface… so I just smile. You smile like that too. But it feels wrong to smile sometimes. Please, don’t force yourself in front of those who are dedicated to you. You are brilliant, even when you don’t hide your pain with a smile. For that matter, please allow me to be the first to swear their loyalty to you. Please allow me to swear my name to you.”</p><p>…She had no idea her sister felt that way at all. The feeling of fear and dread was replaced with shame. She had begun to suspect her sister was hiding her feelings somewhat after the emotional talk with their parents, when Angelica told them of her plans to swear her name. But never had she expected she hid <em> everything </em> she felt behind that pretty smile of hers. She was taken out of her thoughts as she heard Lady Rozemyne finally answer to her sister's words. The tone of the younger archnoble made her own heart hurt slightly, it sounded so… broken.</p><p>“I- I am not worthy of your loy-”</p><p>“You are!”</p><p>Her older sister's shout nearly made her jump in surprise.</p><p>“You are more than worthy! You are so much stronger than me already, I can barely keep up with you in training. If anything, I am not worthy to serve you. A defective sword like me would be no use to anyone, but in your brilliance you may even find some value in me. Please do not doubt your abilities! Allow me to become your very first pillar!”</p><p>Angelica let go of Lady Rozemyne’s hands, which to her surprise, were no longer trembling. Her older sister then assumed her previous stance, normally used in greetings, waiting for a reply.</p><p>“…Becoming my pillar, huh?”</p><p>The hopefulness in that simple sentence was disturbing. What had Lady Rozemyne gone through to react in such a way to her sister’s devotion? Lieseleta recognized now the previous statements of killing her were merely a test from the younger girl. Most likely intended to scare Angelica away from her, for whatever reason. Maybe to protect herself from attachment? She remembered the rumors that Lady Rozemyne was raised in the temple. Just what had happened there to evoke such extreme reactions to a vow of heartfelt loyalty?! </p><p>Lieseleta’s own eyes widened as she watched the most beautiful smile erupt on Lady Rozemyne’s face. It felt so warm and even made her heart flutter slightly just to look at it!</p><p>“Very well, I will accept your loyalty, Angelica.”</p><p>The sheer joy on her older sister’s face was nearly as blinding to look at as Lady Rozemyne’s smile.</p><p>“Thank you, my Lady! I swear I will give my best not to disappoint you! Just order me, and I will obey!”</p><p>Her older sister was still feeling she would disappoint everyone? The shame she felt earlier made a sudden comeback.</p><p>“So, when will you create your namestone? Do you need anything for its creation?”</p><p>“Ah, my family promised to assist me with preparing it. Please wait for it until I have finished my year at the Royal Academy. I will gather the required materials without fail!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne simply chuckled, the breathtaking smile on her face reverting back to her usual polite smile she always wore. It was just armor for her, wasn’t it?</p><p>“I am glad to see you so motivated, but could I ask of you to cast waschen unto myself? The whole conversation took an unexpected toll on me and my appearance.”</p><p>“My first order! Of course I can do that, my Lady! Please close your eyes, and hold your breath for a moment.”</p><p>Angelica looked so happy now, the shame reached a new level. After Lady Rozemyne was freed from the waters of waschen, she noticed that the younger girl was looking at her now, the regret on her face was easy to notice.</p><p>“I am sorry for saying what I did, Lieseleta…”</p><p>She tried to reassure the younger girl. She seemed so different right now, vulnerable even.</p><p>“Do not be, Lady Rozemyne. It was an understandable, if surprising question, at least after I thought about it while you were preoccupied with my older sister. I wonder though…”</p><p>Could she really dare to request what was on her mind now?</p><p>“Do you want to ask me something too, Lieseleta? Please do not tell me you also want to create a namestone, like your sister…”</p><p>She could not help but chuckle before giving her answer.</p><p>“No, nothing of the sort, Lady Rozemyne. But seeing what I did made me curious. Um, it may sound slightly odd to you, but discovering this side of my sister and you made me wonder. Can I- I mean, would you mind- Ahh, this is so awkward after all of this!”</p><p>Why was it feeling so awkward now? She knew she wanted to serve Lady Rozemyne now too. Not just to watch over her older sister, but hearing this broken voice and receiving that beautiful smile. She wanted to protect it! And never hear that tone of voice from her again!</p><p>“I- may I serve you too? Just as an attendant of course! I promise I will look out for my sister so that she will not become too much of a burden to you, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>Why was her sister getting between them now? Could she not see she was desiring to serve the younger girl too? Her own reply was maybe a little bit more heated than intended.</p><p>“What? You know I am right!”</p><p>“You are! But there is no reason to say that before our new Lady!”</p><p>How was it possible to be defeated by the logic of her older sister?! She could not suppress the noise escaping her lips at the sheer ridiculousness of the moment.</p><p>“Hngh!”</p><p>The bell-like laughter erupting from Lady Rozemyne’s lips was as enchanting as her true smile from before. She only got taken out of her trance at her sister's comment.</p><p>“You possess such a beautiful laugh, my Lady. It is nearly as beautiful as your singing. No, it is as beautiful as when you summon Angriff to smite the foes who dare oppose your will!”</p><p>‘!!!’</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>She could not help herself, the response to her sister's total absence of Grammaratur’s blessing was instinctual at this point.</p><p>“What? You know I am right!”</p><p>Her own temper rose as her stupid sister tried to imitate her.</p><p>“Stop trying to imitate what I say! Please forgive my sister, Lady Rozemyne. She is bereft of Grammaratur, as you already know.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne gave both of them a blank look, resulting in Lieseleta to wither somewhat, but she tried to regain her lost composure.</p><p>“Are both of you done?”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I am sorry, my Lady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne simply nodded before speaking again.</p><p>“Good. Lieseleta, why do you suddenly want to enter my service? Did I not just probe your sister if she would kill you on my command?”</p><p>She looked at her own hands before giving her answer.</p><p>“I was shocked, of course. But after witnessing the whole conversation, how could I not desire to serve you too?”</p><p>She looked at her beloved sister for a moment before looking at Lady Rozemyne again, feeling confident in her decision.</p><p>“My older sister may have her own faults, but if she is willing to go to such lengths just to be afforded the chance to serve you, I will trust her judgment.”</p><p>She smiled before continuing to explain herself.</p><p>“Your reaction to the words of my sister only confirmed her trust in your character. I would be honored If you would allow me the chance to become your attendant too, like Tuuliane or Gretia.”</p><p>“I will speak about it with my parents, Lieseleta. I would be glad to have you among my retainers. But would your own parents not want you to serve the Archducal family like them?”</p><p>Lieseleta bowed her head slightly to her potential new Lady, before expressing her thanks.</p><p>“I thank you for the opportunity. I will speak with my parents myself. Please, do not worry about it. I will await Lord Guthried’s and Lady Roselinde’s decision in anticipation.”</p><p>And she was speaking the truth. Should she be worried that Lady Rozemyne was capturing her loyalty nearly at the same speed as her sister’s? It was worth thinking about later perhaps.</p><p>“Very well. Please understand I will require some time alone to gather myself before returning to the playroom.”</p><p>She bowed her head before turning to her older sister, who was still looking so happy it was infectious.</p><p>“But of course, Lady Rozemyne. Come on, Sister, let's return to the playroom ourselves.”</p><p>The rest of the day was uneventful until both of them returned back home. Their parents were already waiting for them, if her older sister's slightly tensed shoulders were anything to go by even she picked up their anxiety.</p><p>“Angelica! Lieseleta! How did the meeting with Lady Rozemyne go?”</p><p>Her father’s concern was clear to hear in his voice. Her sister answered him with a proud smile on her face.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne has agreed to take my name! Lieseleta and I will serve her to the best of our abilities.”</p><p>‘Sister!? Let me bring up my employment on my own accord!’</p><p>Her Father’s shoulders dropped in relief and he heaved a tired sigh. He continued as if he hadn’t noticed her name being mentioned in her sister's exclamation. But apparently her mother had, as she stared at her now in disbelief. This was why she would have preferred to inform them herself…</p><p>“Ah! You succeeded in not offending her with your intentions? I am glad you got your wish, my darling daughter! How did-”</p><p>Her father paused mid-sentence, his eyes growing slightly wider. </p><p>“Wait, what do you mean both you and Lieseleta?! Lieseleta, weren’t you only going to attend the meeting to make sure that your sister didn’t make any mistakes? How did you also join Lady Rozemyne’s service?”</p><p>“I witnessed her reactions when Angelica offered to dedicate her name. What I saw made me… <em> Curious. </em> Lady Rozemyne began with making sure Sister knew what she was saying before rebuking her initially.”</p><p>She paused slightly to think about how to best convey her feelings and observations.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne got… angry at first. She asked my sister if she was willing to kill me for the chance to serve her.”</p><p>“WHAT!?”</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>Her father and mother’s cries of horror made her feel warm inside. She could not describe how happy she was with their new dynamic after her sister declared her wishes to serve Lady Rozemyne. Without her knowledge the young archnoble had already helped their family, she suppressed the desire to chuckle.</p><p>“Do not worry. When Angelica refused because she could not think Lady Rozemyne would ever order her to do it she got really upset at first. But after my sister told her of her thoughts and feelings, she…”</p><p>Lieseleta hesitated to reveal the weakness of her new mistress to her family. Would it be a breach of trust? No, it should be mentioned, maybe her mother could give her some advice later.</p><p>“I think she was… deeply troubled by something… maybe of her past? I do not know how to best describe it, but she may have lost control. Her mana flowed freely, affecting anyone in the room. When I looked at her face, I saw horror and despair. And she felt so distant…”</p><p>She gathered her thoughts for a moment and looked at her parents with a stern expression.</p><p>“But I also saw resignation in her eyes. Angelica managed to snap her out of it, but when she offered her name anew, Lady Rozemyne refused <em> again </em> . She said <em> she herself </em> was not worthy of my sister's loyalty. She looked so devastated and alone at that moment, in my heart I felt that I needed to prevent her from looking like that! Angelica then got through to her and she accepted to receive my sister’s name. She looked so happy then, I want to preserve that beautiful smile! I know she is a master worth serving, I cannot explain it well, but I <em> know </em> it!” </p><p>Her parents looked at her for a moment, before her father simply sighed.</p><p>“So now both of you want to serve her? Please tell me you do not want to present your name to her too, my darling daughter…”</p><p>Lieseleta chuckled before reassuring her resigned looking father.</p><p>“No, I leave that part to my sister.”</p><p>“So you want to serve Lady Rozemyne as her attendant, correct? Should we expect an invitation from her parents soon then? There is much to prepare if it is successful, your move into their estate during your service for example.”</p><p>Her mother brought up a good point.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne agreed to employ my services and that she would talk about it with her parents. So I expect they will send word soon.”</p><p>“...Is this truly what you want, Lieseleta? To serve her as her attendant?”</p><p>She nodded at her parents.</p><p>“Yes, I do want to serve her.”</p><p>“This will bring much scrutiny on us, having both of our daughter’s serve a member of Lady Veronica’s faction, one of them even swearing her name.”</p><p>It was heartwarming that her parents were supportive of her wishes, indicated by the fact her father was thinking aloud over possible consequences.</p><p>“Lady Florencia will ask questions for sure, but I will tell her that Lieseleta is simply searching for employment for training purposes and to watch over her sister. My dear God of Darkness, I do think that the fact we are serving in the castle will allow us to remain neutral for now.”</p><p>“Hmm, at worst it would be seen as us leaning more in Lady Veronica faction’s direction. It should be doable if we insist on remaining neutral.”</p><p>Both her and Angelica excused themselves as their parents were discussing how to best deal with the fallout of the current events. She could not resist giving her sister a last parting remark before they separated at the door to her room.</p><p>“Considering how fast Lady Rozemyne’s parents act, I will most likely enter her service before you can create that namestone, Sister. I will wait for you and welcome you with open arms in her entourage then.”</p><p>The look on her beloved sister’s face was simply sublime.</p><p>“What?! That is so unfair! I wanted to serve Lady Rozemyne first!”</p><p>Lieseleta could not help but laugh before she closed the door of her room in her sister’s face. Her mood lifted even more, as she saw her pet shumils were cuddling! She could not help but swoon at the adorable image!</p><p>The next day in the playroom was going at a more leisure pace. She was currently looking at her notes she took from the conversation with an older academy student in the attendant course when her sister spoke up suddenly.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne is leaving the room with Gretia.”</p><p>She looked at the direction her sister was staring at, and indeed, Lady Rozemyne was on her way out of the playroom, being followed by Tuuliane and Gretia.</p><p>“She did approach Gretia earlier and offered to employ her. It is most likely about that.”</p><p>She decided to pay it no further mind for now. Hopefully, the invitation for her own interview by Lady Rozemyne's parents would come soon. She ignored the grumbling of her sister that she wanted to serve Lady Rozemyne sooner.</p><p>To her surprise, it did not take long until Tuuliane entered the room again and made her way in their direction with unusual haste. Did something go wrong? When Tuuliane arrived, she spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p>“Lady Lieseleta, Lady Angelica. Our Lady requests your presence. There have been… complications, and she desires your assistance in the matter.”</p><p>Before her older sister could reply too loudly and draw unnecessary attention, she answered for both of them.</p><p>“Of course, lead the way.”</p><p>Thankfully Angelica followed her without saying anything, but her happy smile spoke more than words ever could. She was obviously pleased to be called upon so soon, and if Lieseleta was honest with herself, she felt glad about it too. Her happy mood dropped slightly when they arrived and they were ordered to take care of Gretia. The girl was on the ground, grabbing onto Lady Rozemyne’s feet in… happiness? What was wrong with her?! Lieseleta did not chastise her sister as she hauled Gretia to her feet a bit more forcefully than necessary, and simply began to straighten Gretia’s appearance. The absent-minded girl was still giggling, the unfiltered happiness sparking her own curiosity. Then Angelica slapped Gretia!</p><p>“Sister!”</p><p>What by the Seven did she think she was doing?!</p><p>“What? It worked, see?”</p><p>“That is no excuse to hit someone!”</p><p>It seemed her sister was not thinking at all.</p><p>“Still worked though…”</p><p>She ignored her sister’s grumbling and watched Gretia as she tried to regain her lost composure. She was distracted as Lady Rozemyne healed Greatia as if it was a minor inconvenience to expend her mana for others.</p><p>“May Heilschmerz blessing be granted to Gretia. Angelica, cast waschen on her, and let’s leave this room. At this rate I fear what else I will hear inside of it.”</p><p>“As you command, my Lady!”</p><p>Angelica followed Lady Rozemyne’s order as eagerly as her own shumils did when she fed them. In her haste, she disregarded any warning and simply cast the spell on the still recovering Gretia! </p><p>“Warn someone before you cast waschen on them, Sister!”</p><p>“Sorry, I forgot.”</p><p>By the Supreme Couple, her sister could be so…</p><p>“Are you sure you are alright now, Gretia?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you, my Lady. I have never felt better!”</p><p>Why was Gretia sounding similar in fervent pitch as her sister?!</p><p>“Ah, so you serve our Lady now too? Welcome!”</p><p>Gretia looked understandably confused at her thoughtless sister’s statement and decided to question her timidly.</p><p>“Um, do excuse me, but are you not aspiring to become a knight? What do you mean you serve Lady Rozemyne too?”</p><p>“Oh, do not mind that. I have promised to give her my name, so I will serve her soon!”</p><p>Gretia for her part simply looked at her older sister for a moment before nodding, as if it was completely normal to swear one's name to someone…</p><p>“I completely understand. Maybe I will do the same in the future.”</p><p>She had the sudden desire to hold her head.</p><p>“…Great, another one.”</p><p>After all of them returned back to the playroom, she spoke a little bit more with Gretia. Except for her growing zeal in competing with Angelica who was more devoted to Lady Rozemyne, she behaved completely normally, much to her relief.</p><p>The invitation to the Thorwaechter estate for an interview arrived just four days later. Entering the small tea room they were led to, Lieseleta was itching to examine every detail of the decor around them, which was much richer and more elegant than what she was used to, but her gaze was frozen by the sight in front of her. She hoped she managed to hide it in her noble mask, but she had to confess that Lord Guthfried’s scrutinizing stare was making her slightly nervous. Why was he even in this meeting? She had expected Lady Roselinde, not both of them! Lady Rozemyne sent her a slightly apologetic glance before her face changed back into her usual unflappable expression. She and her mother took their offered seats after greetings were exchanged, and Lieseleta braced herself as Lady Roselinde began to speak.</p><p>“Our Rozemyne told us that your daughter wants to serve her as an attendant.”</p><p>“Indeed, Lady Roselinde. Your daughter has made quite the impression on mine. We would be honored if she could be permitted to serve as a pillar to the Lady she chose.”</p><p>Lady Roselinde regarded both of them with a polite smile, making it impossible to read her current thoughts before she replied to her mother’s words.</p><p>“Anhaltung has guided your daughter well, and as Rozemyne’s Wiegenmilch I do wish for her to be supported by sturdy pillars. Of course, to ensure Chaosfliehe remains protecting my daughter, it is important to understand the motivation of each new pillar. Lieseleta, would you care to tell me why you wish to serve my daughter?”</p><p>Lieseleta was surprised that she would be included in the meeting already, she had not expected to be outright asked about her <em> own </em> wishes so soon.</p><p>“I saw firsthand how Lady Rozemyne reacted to my sister’s request. I recognized that she is a Lady well worth serving, also I-“</p><p>She was hesitant to speak so bluntly. But she did not know how to convey her feelings otherwise.</p><p>“I want to preserve that smile Lady Rozemyne showed after accepting my sister’s devotion. I will wholeheartedly strive to make my Lady as happy and comfortable as possible.”</p><p>She stole a glance at Lady Rozemyne, noticing her eyes had widened slightly showing her surprise. When she looked at Lady Roselinde again, her polite smile had changed into a warmer version of it, her eyes slightly sparkling. She seemed pleased with her honest answer.</p><p>“How very honorable of you. It would bring me joy to see my daughter’s smile more often indeed. In return for your honest answer, allow me to play Anhaltung to you and your Wiegenmilch.”</p><p>Her mother spoke up instead of herself.</p><p>“Please do, Lady Roselinde.”</p><p>“Soon, the season for banquets of Kunstzeal and Cuococalura will be upon us, and as a pillar you would be seen by the many goddesses of light and water who attend under the bright light of the one who wears the supreme crown. This will most certainly be taken as Flutrane blessing your house with her ever changing waters, especially as Ordoschnelli takes flight so frequently at these occasions… Of course, depending on your intentions, Lady Maxine, those melodies could be sweet or bitter to your ears. Have you considered what way you wish Schutzaria’s winds to blow?”</p><p>Mother nodded at the warning before giving Lady Roselinde words of assurance. Lieseleta noticed that the polite smile her own mother wore now began to resemble the one Lady Roselinde had given her earlier. </p><p>“Bitter melodies can be sweetened with the right words, Lady Roselinde. That is for the Goddess of Light to shine her light upon, and not her daughter to concern herself with.”</p><p>A warm feeling bloomed in her stomach as her mother sent Lieseleta a glance after finishing her statement. It was just further proof that her decision was the right one. Lady Rozemyne was indirectly responsible for her family's newfound closeness.</p><p>“…Wiegenmilch is a Goddess of Mercy for a reason indeed. The Goddess of Light would dim her own light if it could brighten her daughter’s future, would she not?”</p><p>“I have no doubt.”</p><p>Why was it that Lady Roselinde and her mother were looking at each other so familiar now? Was she missing something? She looked at Lady Rozemyne who was looking at her own mother with warmth in her own eyes as well. She <em> was </em> missing something here!</p><p>“Ordoschnelli can be swayed, but with your older daughter swearing under Gebordnung to my Rozemyne, it will be quite the trial of Glucklitat.”</p><p>She was taken out of her musings as Lady Roselinde brought up her older sister. Surprisingly it was Lord Guthfried who spoke up instead.</p><p>“Of course, as she could not have done so without my influence as Anhaltung, it is only right that we act as Schutzaria to her, and by extent, you.”</p><p>Lady Roselinde nodded at her husband's words before taking back the reins of the conversation.</p><p>“Perhaps we could suggest in our respective social circles that Lieseleta’s employment under Rozemyne is more of a temporary measure we insisted on to ensure our Rozemyne is not burdened with looking after your own child.”</p><p>“Would that really be acceptable? We have discussed something similar, but we could not dare to think that you would support such stray Ordoschnelli.”</p><p>Her mother’s worries were understandable, so it was relieving to hear Lady Roselinde offering her support. Even if the fact they had to make her wishes sound like she was just watching over her beloved older sister left a slightly sour taste in her mouth.</p><p>“Oh, it is no trouble at all, we will always support our darling daughter in her wishes!”</p><p>“Yes, indeed. Now that this is handled, should we discuss living arrangements?”</p><p>The meeting quickly came to a close after agreeing on the details and her payment. The following days were filled with her move into the room provided to her inside of the Thorwaechter estate. The room was nearly as big as her own at home, so she had no reason to complain. She was then introduced to the other attendants and close servants in Lady Rozemyne’s employ.</p><p>Lady Mathilde was currently Lady Rozemyne’s head attendant, so Lieseleta spoke to her first about what would be expected from her now that she had officially joined Lady Rozemyne’s entourage. She was as nice to her as her first impression made her believe, she even offered to address her just by her name. Lieseleta accepted and offered the same courtesy to the kind older woman. They had just begun their discussion when she felt something touching her left leg, startling her. She looked down and saw a small zantze rubbing itself against her!?</p><p>“Oh dear, it seems Hisui has taken a liking to you, Lieseleta.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>She lost her composure, she knew of the saying about shumils and zantze, of course. So seeing one of those abominable killer’s rub itself against her leg was terrifying! Mathilde simply chuckled as the dangerous feybeast continued nuzzling her leg!?</p><p>“Do not worry. This zantze’s name is Hisui, she is the favored pet of our Lady and completely harmless unless threatened. She seems to like you too, Lieseleta. I have never seen her going out of her way to show affection to anyone beside our Lady.”</p><p>Lieseleta forcefully calmed herself at this explanation. She was about to speak up when Tuuliane rushed into the room.</p><p>“Hisui! Lady Rozemyne has forbidden you from wandering around while there are new people around! Come here!”</p><p>“Mew…”</p><p>She had to suppress a squeal as the zantze lowered its head and looked… chastised now? So cute… Wait… was it understanding what Tuuliane was saying?! She watched as Tuuliane stepped closer and picked the feline into her arms.</p><p>“I am sorry, Lady Lieseleta. She escaped me earlier, it was not my intention to startle you.”</p><p>“I told you she likes exploring the house, Tuuliane. Just let her be.”</p><p>“Milady!”</p><p>Everyone in the room bowed their heads as Lady Rozemyne herself entered the room. Her soft chastisement of Tuuliane sounded to be more playful and exasperated than truly serious.</p><p>“Hisui.”</p><p>The small zantze jumped out of Tuuliane’s hold and ran at Lady Rozemyne, before jumping on her outstretched arm. The feline then started to climb on Lady Rozemyne’s right shoulder, seemingly getting comfortable. Her small tail coiled around her mistress's neck, dangling on her left side. She then started to purr in delight when Lady Rozemyne began to rub her head with her right hand.</p><p>‘!!!’</p><p>She nearly squealed again at the adorable sight! It was so cute!</p><p>“Ah, milady, actually I just watched how Hisui began to rub Lieseleta’s leg. I think she has taken a liking to her already.”</p><p>Lieseleta was taken out of her dreamy thoughts when Mathilde spoke up in the silent room.</p><p>“Really? How unusual. Seeing as Tuuliane is struggling to contain my adorable Hisui, would you like to try your hand at it, Lieseleta?”</p><p>She was torn. Watching the tamed zantze’s behavior was cute, but the feybeast was still the natural enemy of any shumil, the animal she loved with all her heart! But it looked so adorable on Lady Rozemyne’s shoulder too… But it would be her first request by her new Lady, so she nodded her head and accepted the responsibility, not trusting her voice right now.</p><p>“Excellent. Hisui, be a good girl and do not trouble Lieseleta. She is <em> mine </em>, do you understand?”</p><p>“Mew!”</p><p>The slightly possessive tone in her Lady’s voice as she called Lieseleta made her heart flutter. She decided to ignore those thoughts for now as the small zantze gave a nod with her head! Could the feybeast – Could Hisui really understand them? Dregarnuhr’s weaving would show if her musings were correct.</p><p>With this strange chain of events she became the new caretaker of Hisui, much to Tuuliane’s relief. Apparently she was really struggling to contain the smart feline. Lieseleta could not understand why, Hisui was as well mannered as she was adorable. She followed commands and apparently loved it when she petted her, making it laughably easy to contain her inside of her lap. Her purring was calming to listen to as well.</p><p>She was almost reluctant to leave the cute thing’s side to attend to her other chores, but she could not fail as an attendant.</p><p>“Lieseleta, Gretia.”</p><p>Mathilde called them over in the afternoon.</p><p>“Tuuliane and I will be accompanying Lady Rozemyne to spend time with Lady Roselinde and Lord Guthfried for the rest of the day. I expect this to last a bell or two, so in the meanwhile, can I ask you two to prepare our Lady’s chambers for the evening? Gretia already knows what needs to be done, so you can just follow her lead, Lieseleta.”</p><p>“Of course, Mathilde.”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>She put Hisui down and joined Gretia in their Lady’s chambers. She tried her best not to let her mind wander as she followed Gretia’s lead in tidying books away, making the bed, laying out the right night clothes and setting the bath to the correct temperature. As they sat down in the retainers’ room for a short break, however, she couldn’t help her curiosity anymore.</p><p>“So it is true? You have really been adopted by Mathilde?”</p><p>As soon as she said it, she realized the question might be too invasive to just ask out of the blue, but luckily Gretia nodded with a soft smile.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne arranged the adoption for me, and I couldn’t be more grateful. Lady Mathilde has become a <em> wonderful </em> mother to me in such a short period of time.”</p><p>“I am glad to hear. She seems very kind.”</p><p>Gretia smiled peacefully before speaking up again, sounding strangely relieved?</p><p>“I am happy to have another noble of similar age serving our lady. Of course, Tuuliane is here, but their relationship can’t compare.”</p><p>Lieseleta was slightly confused, did she mean the fact that Tuuliane was already serving Lady Rozemyne before entering the playroom? All of them joined service to their Lady with no big difference in timing, what made Tuuliane's early entry into service that notable? She decided to speak about her sister to slightly mask her confusion. </p><p>“My sister will be joining us in no time too, she is quite eager.”</p><p>“I have no doubt, she is swearing her name after all! Does that make you feel conflicted?”</p><p>Did it? Well if she was honest with herself she was appalled and terrified at first, she would lose her beloved older sister. But after witnessing the moment where Angelica voiced her wishes to Lady Rozemyne those doubts were laid to rest.</p><p>“It did at first, but not anymore. Not since I saw how Lady Rozemyne handled her request, and how well our Lady treats us all. I also enjoy the thought of serving the same master as my sister, so we will get to spend more time together.”</p><p>“I don’t really know what that feels like, if I’m honest. To have a sister you wish to be close with. But it seems like a nice feeling. It must be why Lady Rozemyne spends so much time with Tuuliane.”</p><p>Gretia looked down at her hands, seemingly lost in her own thoughts. Wait… did she just imply that Tuuliane was Lady Rozemyne’s sister?! She should have ignored this slip, but curiosity won over and she decided to ask Gretia more directly.</p><p>“Are you implying…?”</p><p>Gretia looked up from her hands, a slightly mischievous smile on her lips as she answered her unasked question.</p><p>“I believe you will find it quite obvious yourself once you spend enough time in the mansion, especially when Lady Roselinde and Lady Rozemyne are together with Tuuliane attending to her. Lady Roselinde looks at them both the same way.”</p><p>“Oh my…”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne was raised in the temple, but was bought back into her family and baptized as Lady Roselinde’s daughter. Could something similar have happened with Tuuliane? She was a laynoble, so could it have been that she was born with a low mana capacity?</p><p>“So I am quite relieved that I am no longer the only one in the know in the playroom.”</p><p>“My, that must have been quite the secret to keep under Verbergen’s veil all by yourself! I’ll be very glad to share this with you. Don’t expect much from my sister, I doubt she would spend her energy on thinking about anything not related to Angriff.”</p><p>Both of them shared a chuckle at the expense of her older sister. The mood in the room they were resting in became even more comfortable than before.</p><p>“There aren’t many other ladies in the playroom close to our ages, and the boys are too busy playing Leidenschaft to let Ordoschnelli pass between them.”</p><p>Lieseleta could only agree with Gretia’s assessment. If the rumors and her older sister's obsession with Lady Rozemyne told her anything, then their Lady surpassed them all at this point. Why were boys so obsessed with Leidenschaft and Angriff anyway?</p><p>“Yes, they make quite the spectacle of themselves, do they not? It is only Lady Brunhilde and Lady Leonore who might be paying attention to our Lady rather than the fighting.”</p><p>“I doubt they would ever approach our Lady or me, being in the opposing faction. If they approached anyone, it would be you, Lieseleta, if your family is still known to be neutral.”</p><p>They may have before, but with her serving Lady Rozemyne – A member of Lady Veronica’s faction – they would be more cautious in their approach to her. In addition, they seemed to prefer each other's company over anyone else’s.</p><p>“I doubt they would approach me more than once. They always seem quite content to talk among themselves. Still, two ladies so firmly in the Leisegang faction, I do wonder what kind of Ordoschnelli flies between them.”</p><p>“I have heard of one melody that apparently flew from their clan towards neutrals before landing on Lady Roselinde’s shoulders. I heard it not long ago when I was attending to Lady Rozemyne over dinner with her mother. Apparently, there are rumors that Giebe Illgner and his family are inappropriately close with the commoners of their province.”</p><p>Inappropriately close with the commoners? She could not understand why Gretia was so shocked by those rumors, It was known to anyone that Giebe Illgner was close to his populace.</p><p>“Is that truly so shocking, Gretia? It is a rural province, I heard they have treated the commoners somewhat differently for a while now.”</p><p>“I have thought that myself. But according to the rumor, the Giebe himself eats the same food at the same table as commoners!”</p><p>A startled gasp escaped Lieseleta’s lips. They were <em> that </em> close?</p><p>“I nearly dropped the tea pot when I heard! But Lady Rozemyne was not surprised at all at first. She probably didn’t believe the rumor. Or maybe she was not showing her surprise. She is… hard to read…”</p><p>Their Lady was very adept in hiding her emotions behind the armor of her polite smile. If the incident which led to her employment had not happened, she would have praised Lady Rozemyne as the perfect Lady. But seeing her mastery of noble bearing in action was still awe inducing. Deep down Lieseleta knew she would be hard pressed to ever compare to the level of refinement her Lady was already displaying at <em> seven </em>. </p><p>“She is indeed. But it is our job to learn to read her wishes.”</p><p>Their pleasant chat was interrupted as the door to Lady Rozemyne chambers opened, causing both of them to stand up from their resting places. Most likely Lady Rozemye had returned, so their break time was over. When they entered the main room of their Lady’s chambers, it was not Lady Rozemyne but her mother instead. Lady Roselinde was carrying her sleeping daughter lovingly in her arms! Lieseleta had to put her hand over her mouth to not squeal loudly, Lady Rozemyne looked just like an adorable little shumil! All curled up on her mother’s chest! She was nearly overloaded with cuteness!?</p><p>It took Lieseleta a moment to regain her composure, when she did she glanced around and noticed Greatia was nearly swooning too! By the seven, Mathilde was openly showing a fond expression on her face!?</p><p>It was such a stark contrast to the usual image Lady Rozemyne presented. She had more in common with her pet zantze Hisui than a shumil but seeing her like this? It was just too adorable!</p><p>‘Not that she does not look adorable normally as well, wait… Do I like zantzes now too? Hisui is adorable, and so is Lady Rozemyne. But right now Lady Rozemyne looks like a cute little shumil… Ah, both impressions are so cute! But which one is cuter?!’</p><p>Lady Roselinde handed the little sleeping shumil over to them, and whispered some instructions to try to change her without waking her if possible, however as soon as her arms left Lady Rozemyne’s back, she blinked at them with sleepy eyes. She was a bit disappointed not to be able to follow the instructions, but a half awake lady was at least easier to change and tuck in than an asleep one. Lieseleta bid her goodbye once the curtains around Lady Rozemyne’s bed closed – both Gretia and Mathilde were staying in adjacent rooms in case their lady needed something during the night – and made her way to her own new room.</p><p>As much as she wanted to get to know her new home better, the day was long and exciting enough that Schlaftraum claimed her as soon as she pulled her blanket over herself. The God of Dreams blessed her night with visions full of adorable shumils and zantzes playing together peacefully…</p><p>She was up bright and early the next day. Her tasks were to help Lady Rozemyne get ready in the morning for breakfast, then she had some down time while her lady trained with her father. She was to join Tuuliane towards the end of the session, to help wash and change their lady before a light lunch, followed by her regular music lesson, and some reading time.</p><p>She blinked for a moment as she received the schedule. Reading time? Why was her Lady using her downtime to read? It would certainly explain the tomes she was tasked with ordering earlier, but still a curious hobby for an aspiring lady knight to have. She began to help prepare Lady Rozemyne for the day as her lady’s hair was braided. Lady Rozemyne seemed to pick up on her marveling at the shine of her hair, as she brought up rinsham in the conversation.</p><p>“Lieseleta, I just remembered that you did not have access to rinsham previously. That simply will not do, you may also use the ones stocked for my retainers. Delia can wash your hair and show you how it is applied.”</p><p>Lieseleta's eyes widened slightly. Lady Rozemyne gave rinsham to her retainers? The miraculous product was only available to members of the Veronica faction so far, that was true. And of course the rumors talked about how it was Lady Rozemyne who invented the product, before being forced to pretend she received it from Lady Veronica. But her Lady gave the expensive product away for free?! She threw a glance at the others, currently dressing Lady Rozemyne, and received only exasperation from Tuuliane, while Gretia and Delia continued to look at their Lady with a strange note of… zeal?</p><p>“I am most thankful, Lady Rozemyne. I look forward to seeing its effects firsthand, if the hair of the others is anything to go by it truly seems to work wonders.”</p><p>“It still pales in comparison to our Lady’s divine locks. Truly one could get envious looking at her midnight colored hair. It is as if she has received the blessing of the God of Darkness and Sterrat themselves! Just like Goddess Mestionora in her youth, like in the scripture!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s eyebrow twitched slightly when the Goddess was mentioned, before seemingly ignoring the rest of Delia’s zealous praising. Lieseleta was informed that Lady Rozemyne had taken some of her former temple servants with her – Delia being among them – so while such a direct reference to the scripture was jarring to hear, it was not unexpected. Gretia of course refuted the young girl, but not quite for the reason Lieseleta was expecting.</p><p>“You are wrong, Delia. Not even Goddess Mestionora could compare with our Lady’s looks.”</p><p>“…I am humbled to say you are right, Lady Gretia. Not even a Goddess could compare to Lady Rozemyne’s splendor!”</p><p>…What was Lieseleta even listening to? The resigned looks on everyone else’s faces told her it was better to simply ignore both of them, as the level of praise for Lady Rozemyne continued. It was as if Gretia and Delia were in competition to who could praise their Lady more. Lieseleta had to try hard not to outright giggle at the strange dynamic currently taking place before her. Serving Lady Rozemyne was more fun than she had initially thought.</p><p>Lieseleta was allowed to stay behind with Delia when their Lady departed from her chambers to eat with her family.</p><p>“You may rest easy, Lady Lieseleta. I will gather the available scents provided to Milady's entourage. I hope one of them will be to your liking. Please take a seat, I will be back as fast as Steifebrise, the Goddess of the Gale!”</p><p>Lieseleta blinked as the young redhead crossed her arms and bowed her head before departing. There were scents? As in multiple variants? And she could choose which one she liked most? Her Lady seemed to like spoiling her retainers. Delia was back as fast as she promised, rolling a simple wagon into the room and presenting her with more than ten variations, all of them of the highest quality!? She ultimately decided on a jar that brought to mind the herby smell of cuddling her pet shumils after feeding them some special snacks. She could detect hints of lage and smimosa, but there were other scents she didn’t recognise. It was quite pleasant.</p><p>Once she selected the jar, Delia began explaining to her how to best apply and use rinsham.</p><p>“After you apply rinsham and begin washing Lady Rozemyne’s hair, it would be best if you spent a generous amount of time massaging her scalp with the foam it creates. Our Lady seems to really enjoy the combination and is more relaxed afterwards, making the following message a little bit easier and faster.”</p><p>Lieseleta took note of Delia’s tips on their Lady’s preferences. She had served Lady Rozemyne the longest out of all of them. She may be a former gray apprentice shrine maiden, but Lieselta would be a fool to not use her acquired knowledge to heighten Lady Rozemyne’s comfort.</p><p>“You should apply rinsham to our Lady’s hair generously, Lady Lieseleta, to truly bring out the God of Darkness’ blessing. Of course, Lady Rozemyne looks divine, no matter the preparation of her hair, but since our Lady’s appearance is blessed by the Gods, we must do our utmost to ensure that she looks the best she could be! It wouldn’t do for her to look ill prepared, and be looked down upon by other nobles! A Saint like her has to be worshiped and appreciated by those following her shining example. She looks most divine when blessing our ears with her singing, envied by even Kunstzeal herself, or when enjoying a book when she looks so much like the Goddess of Wisdom she resembles, but of course those sights are only for those worthy to be in her presence. So her hair and dress must reflect that divinity in any occasion, to ensure that all who are blessed to be in her presence recognise her true magnificence and know to follow and worship her from just a simple look. For she is merciful, looking after even us former gray robed shrine maidens, like she was blessed by the Goddess of Mercy herself, and wise beyond all knowledge Mestionora possesses, beyond even what any Erwachlehren could teach, not to mention her blessings from Efflorelume, and all the divine five. I am hopeful I will be able to witness our Lady’s divine blessings from Kunstzeal and Leidenschaft today, if Dregarnuhr is gracious enough to spin my thread to intersect with Lady Rozemyne’s training and music practice. How blessed we are to have these opportunities.” </p><p>Lieseleta felt slightly overwhelmed as Delia continued her monologue about Lady Rozemyne. To her credit, she did not stop or even slow in her efforts towards Lieseleta’s hair, the calming scent of her choosing now coming from her own hair did much to keep her relaxed as the redheaded girl suddenly stopped in her praise of their Lady.</p><p>“Your hair is reminiscent of the color of Flutrane, the Goddess of Water. Lady Lieseleta. It is smooth to the touch and easy to wash.”</p><p>Only to praise Lieseleta instead.</p><p>“Thank you, Delia. I do not want to offend, but could I ask why you revere Lady Rozemyne so much? Even going as far as calling her a saint?”</p><p>It came up multiple times, so she was curious about its origin.</p><p>“Oh. It is because Lady Rozemyne saved me in the temple. Well, she saved all of us would be more correct I guess. She is also more blessed by the gods than any simple mortal could ever hope to be. Please close your eyes for a moment, Lady Lieseleta.”</p><p>She followed the request as Delia began to use warm water to wash away any lingering remains of rinsham from her head.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne never called herself a saint, but she does not need to. Any gray robe, current or former, knows of what she did for us. She saved me- us from… unkind masters, and reformed the temple orphanage. It was an awful place before her. Most were starving, there was just silent suffering until you either died, or a blue priest found some use for you. She gave us clothing, food, care and purpose. Never did she demand anything in return aside from helping her create her products. She gave us a chance to prove our worth, when everyone else looked away. How could we not see her gracious nature, and call her for what she is? An emissary of the Gods, a true saint. And that was before we started serving her with all our hearts, and discovered even more of her abundant blessings.”</p><p>Lieseleta was taken aback at the dark turn. Delia’s tone was somber, most likely reminiscing about her past.</p><p>“So all of us will do our best to live up to Lady Rozemyne’s expectations of us. To be granted the chance of being able to serve her after her return to nobility is the greatest honor I can imagine! I will give my all to serve her the best I can!”</p><p>To witness this level of loyalty from a commoner to a noble was unexpected. The worlds they lived in were so different, and Lady Rozemyne still saw it worthwhile to help those below her, only asking for them to work for her? </p><p>She got lost in her thoughts as Delia had dried her hair and was beginning to braid it, restoring Lieseleta’s original hairstyle. The redhead was really skilled in haircare, and it took her even less time than her <em> own </em> attendant every morning. Lady Rozemyne seemed to pull only truly skilled individuals into her retinue.</p><p>After that enlightening conversation she had some downtime on her hands, so Lieseleta decided to simply sit on a comfortable chair. Hisui jumped into her lap without any prompting, earning the adorably feybeast a rub behind its ears. She nearly got lost in Dregarnuhr’s spinning as she pampered the adorable feline, until she remembered she had to join Tuuliane before the training session of their Lady ended. She stood up and made her way towards the training grounds in the gardens, Hisui’s warm and soft body still pressed into her own. The sound of fighting was hard to miss, and got only louder as they reached their destination. Lady Rozemyne seemed to be locked in an intensive looking spar against her own father, Lord Guthfried. It was the first time for Lieseleta to see her Lady’s combat prowess first hand. As she got closer and took her place beside the younger laynoble attendant, she could only watch the fight in slight awe.</p><p>Both of the combatants were moving faster than her eyes could perceive, only blurs leaving gashes in the ground, craters erupting and the wind blowing from their clashes. Occasionally they stopped, either in a weapon-lock or when Lord Guthfried got up after being defeated by his own daughter. It was absurd to see a <em> seven-year-old girl </em> beat an experienced and accomplished knight in single combat so effortlessly. She even <em> healed </em> him in between matches!? She realized it was no wonder that Lord Bonifatius and her beloved older sister took an immediate liking to her. Lady Rozemyne seemed more like a War-Goddess than a young girl! She thanked the Gods for her noble training or she would no doubt embarrass herself by gaping at the display before her very eyes. She was still silently reeling from the experience as the training was concluded. Hisui began to struggle somewhat in her arms, so she let the zantze go to join her mistress. She wordlessly followed Lady Rozemyne back to her chambers to refresh, the sight of Hisui on her shoulder still adorable to witness.</p><p>The time until the music lesson was uneventful, it was only when Lady Rozemyne began to sing a song that Lieseleta was exposed to the <em> divine </em> singing voice of her Lady. She was so lost in the soft tunes of the song she only realized she had entered Schlaftraum’s realm while awake when Mathilde shook her light by the shoulder, giving her an understanding look. She had heard Lady Rozemyne singing before at her debut, but this close was a whole different experience. At least she was not the only one affected…</p><p>Lieseleta got even more downtime when it was time to serve their Lady in her reading time inside of the impressive bookroom of the estate. Lady Rozemyne got so lost in her reading there was practically no need for any attendant at all. Thankfully Gretia volunteered to watch over their Lady, so Lieseleta had the opportunity to leave the room briefly to look after Hisui, seeing as the care of the adorable feybeast was still one of her main duties. She returned to the book room just before the bell rang to let Lady Rozemyne know her reading time had come to an end – and she had to cover her mouth with her hand to suppress a squeal as soon as she entered. Lady Rozemyne was still in the comically large armchair she left her in, however instead of sitting like a lady, and reading, she was curled up into a little ball on the cushion of the chair, hugging the book to her chest, asleep with the sweetest smile on her face. Gretia was standing slightly beside the door to her right, seemingly fretting if she should wake their Lady or simply adore the cute scenery, according to her quiet mumbles. A similar muffled sound and footsteps hurrying out the door behind her let her know that Mathilde noticed the adorable sight too, and just barely managed to contain herself.</p><p>As she debated what to do, whether she should wake her lady up, or call for someone to carry her, the door to the reading room opened again, and Lady Roselinde entered quietly, Mathilde now in tow.</p><p>“Lieseleta.”</p><p>Lady Roselinde addressed her in a whisper, never taking her eyes off of Lady Rozemyne. The intensity of her eyes was almost scary…</p><p>“Yes, Lady Roselinde?”</p><p>“Run down to the servants’ quarters and fetch Wilma for me. Quickly.”</p><p>“At once.”</p><p>She crossed her arms in acknowledgement, before hurrying out of the room as quickly and as quietly as she could. Once outside, she looked for the first servant she could find, and asked to be led to find Wilma. The room they eventually entered towards the back of the estate was somewhat on the small side, but perfectly clean. Four simple beds stood along the walls, a large desk covered in art supplies underneath the window, a pair of chairs with small back rests typically used for playing harspiel, and regular furniture one would expect to find in living quarters. Decoration was minimal, except for a surprisingly high quality harspiel on one shelf, and dozens and dozens of beautiful drawings. Inside of the room were three women – one of them she recognized as the music instructor from earlier – sitting at a small lunch table, who quickly knelt and crossed their arms as Lieseleta entered.</p><p>Wasting no time, she informed them that Lady Roselinde had called for Wilma, and was waiting in the book room, before turning around and hurrying back the way she came, expecting the right woman to follow her. She was surprised to realize that <em> all three </em> were walking behind her, although one of them – the blonde-haired one – grabbed some of the art supplies from the table and a couple of thin wooden boards. Lieseleta decided against questioning them and simply led them towards the book room. As they approached their destination, the other two fell a couple paces behind, and only the one carrying the supplies was following right behind her.</p><p>“I have come as you requested, Lady Roselinde.”</p><p>The woman, Wilma, entered the room behind her while the others waited outside, and she immediately knelt before Lady Roselinde, although she struggled to hold the right pose with the supplies she was carrying in her hands. Lady Roselinde didn’t seem to mind at all. In fact, there appeared to be some kind of bond between them, as she gestured for Wilma to stand straight away, and the woman’s hand started flying over the board she held without any further instructions. Her now sparkling eyes looking between the boards and Lady Rozemyne? </p><p>Lady Roselinde hovered near Wilma’s shoulder the entire time, letting out the quietest squeals every once in a while, as her hand disappeared with puffs of gold. Lieseleta eventually concluded that Wilma must be an exclusive artist – for the family? Or maybe just Lady Rozemyne? Come to think of it, she was sure she spotted a few drawings of her Lady in the room the women stayed in, which she first chalked up to drawings of the goddess Mestionora in her rush. Wait… was Wilma sketching her Lady as she slept?! Well, it seemed to be on Lady Roselinde’s orders, so there was nothing that could be done.</p><p>Four sketches later, Lady Roselinde was satisfied with the last one. After instructing Mathilde to follow her, she carried Lady Rozemyne to her chambers, leaving the rest of them behind in the book room.</p><p>“I shall take my leave then, Lieseleta, unless you need me to lock the book room.”</p><p>Lieseleta could not help but look at Gretia with slight exasperation. Did she not just stare at their Lady unashamedly as she slept? Even if it was to Lady Roselinde’s delight, it should not have happened at all under her watch. On the other hand, she was similarly trapped in indecision upon her entry, so could Gretia truly be blamed? Lieseleta decided to ignore it this time.</p><p>“I shall be fine to lock it myself, Gretia. May Schlaftraum bless you.”</p><p>“Yes, may Schlaftraum bless you as well.”</p><p>Lieseleta’s gaze switched to Wilma, causing the woman to kneel before her, the boards with the sketches clutched to her chest like some sort of treasure.</p><p>“Wilma, do you need to do anything else in here to complete your drawing for Lady Roselinde?”</p><p>“No, Lady Lieseleta, I have my supplies and the sketch, I can start drawing anywhere with sufficient light.”</p><p>The blond woman seemed very eager to start right away. How odd.</p><p>“Very good, let us leave then.”</p><p>They left the book room without any more words exchanged between them. Lieseleta closed the sturdy doors behind her and locked the room. As she turned around, she noticed the other two women who had followed were still here. Wilma was favored by Lady Roselinde, so it would maybe be best to provide her a good source of lighting for her artwork. </p><p>“Would you all care to join me in the retainers’ room for a while? The magic tool in there should provide more light than candles would.”</p><p>“Your offer is most generous, Lady Lieseleta, but we are simple exclusives of Lady Rozemyne, not retainers. We couldn’t possibly overstep…”</p><p>The brown haired woman began to timidly refute her offer until the still unnamed woman refuted her before even Lieseleta herself could.</p><p>“You worry too much, Rosina. Lady Lieseleta is our Lady’s attendant.”</p><p>“I do believe that as Lady Rozemyne’s attendant, it is my job to ensure that her exclusive painter has the right working conditions. Surely Wilma drawing in the retainers’ room is no issue.”</p><p>Her explanation seemed to satisfy them as they chorused their agreement in near synchrony. </p><p>“Of course, Lady Lieseleta.”</p><p>“And I have heard that you all served Lady Rozemyne before in the temple as attendants. So you both should know how to serve tea to a noble, yes? So there would be no problem in you accompanying me to the room to serve tea, and if the topic of Lady Rozemyne comes up, it is a mere coincidence.”</p><p>The mere mention of Lady Rozemyne’s name had a profound effect on all of them. Wilma and Rosina's eyes began to sparkle, whereas the other woman's eyes wore more resemblance to Gretia or Delia. All of them gave her eager nods before she began to guide them towards the room for their Lady’s retainers. It took not long for them to arrive, the still unnamed woman excusing herself to brew tea for them all, leaving Lieseleta alone with Wilma and Rosina. Lieseleta finally got a good look at the sketches as all of them sat down at the table. She was not as adept in Kunstzeal’s domain as her mother, but even Lieseleta could tell that Wilma was truly blessed if those were just her <em> sketches </em>of Lady Rozemyne.</p><p>“My, she truly looks just like a sleeping shumil! You have captured Lady Rozemyne’s adorableness very well, Wilma.”</p><p>“I don’t deserve such high praise, Lady Lieseleta. I am not sure what a shumil looks like, but it is as you say, Lady Rozemyne is quite adorable when she sleeps. It feels as if Kunstzeal herself is holding my hand to ensure I capture the sight as closely as possible. I am sure it is merely the Goddess’ interest in Lady Rozemyne that allows me to draw her well.”</p><p>Before Lieseleta could respond it was Rosina’s turn to add to the conversation. She didn't even need to prompt them any further.</p><p>“One needs only listen to Lady Rozemyne’s singing to know that Kunstzeal must follow her every step. Did you hear her singing for the first time today, Lady Lieseleta? Our Lady’s divine blessing of music can have a profound effect on those who hear it.”</p><p>“No, I heard her before at the winter debut, Rosina, but this was quite different. Still, you should accept the praise, Wilma, Kunstzeal surely blessed you as well to draw such excellent pictures. Lady Roselinde is blessed by Seheweit to have you preserve these precious moments.”</p><p>They were interrupted as the unnamed woman returned with tea for them all. She really had to ask what her name was.</p><p>“Indeed, Lady Roselinde must have the protection of Anhaltung as well! She recognised the opportunity Wilma presented as soon as we arrived after they had graciously purchased us from the temple. Lady Roselinde is one of the few who saw our Lady as the Saint she is the moment she laid eyes on her.”</p><p>“Ah yes, you have spent a long time with Lady Rozemyne before she returned to her family, haven’t you, …?”</p><p>“Jenni. Apologies, Lady Lieseleta. I haven’t had the opportunity to formally introduce myself.”</p><p>Lieseleta simply shook her head before smiling at Jenni.</p><p>“There is no need, Jenni. But why don’t you tell me about your time with our Lady so I can learn more about her preferences? I wish to understand her will as well as a first-rate attendant should.”</p><p>That was a mistake. If she thought Delia and Gretia were bad for worshiping their lady beyond noble sensibilities, she would have to re-evaluate her assessment after the praise that followed her question.</p><p>It was mostly the feats of their Lady inside of the temple she already heard about, only with more details and gushing than even from Delia. Lieseleta learned that Jenni had acted as the head attendant of Lady Rozemyne inside of the temple, before all of them were bought by her parents upon her explicit request. Another new fact was that Lady Rozemyne was dealing with some merchants directly on more than one occasion. Sadly, she got little more information from them, except for the new appreciation of the tame level of worship Gretia and Delia showed towards Lady Rozemyne. If anything, she understood Lady Rozemyne’s will even less, as the former shrine maidens refused to consider their lady as a ‘simple mortal’ with dreams and wishes of her own.</p><p>Dregarnuhr spun their threads through colorful tales of Grammaratur and no doubt melodies of Ordoschnelli, until Wilma had finished honoring Kunstzeal, and it was high time for them all to greet Schlaftraum for the day. The God of Darkness was already well on his way, traversing the night sky.</p>

    <p>The unexpected ‘duel’ with Lamprecht was just sad to witness. Rozemyne had nothing against him personally even if they weren’t that close in the past weave, but seeing him struggle against her this much when she was going so easy on him, nowhere close to her former might in battle was just… disappointing. She tried to end it before his pride and dignity was completely destroyed – she still needed him to work with her after all – but that was when he stood up and said that one sentence he <em>really </em>shouldn’t have.</p><p>“I will not be defeated by a little former temple flower!”</p><p>“…former temple flower?”</p><p>It was the second time that she felt true anger since traveling back in time. Why would he spout<b> <em> that specific insult?!</em> </b> Just when she thought she wouldn’t hear it for a while at least… She would <strike>kill</strike> re-educate him for even daring to bring that accursed phrase up in her presence! She had had enough of that damn insult from the last weave! It was bad enough that it followed her like a bad omen even after her days at the Royal Academy, she would not allow it to haunt her again if she could do something about it! Hearing a part of her old family – even if Lamprecht was always distant – smearing her in this manner was unacceptable. She ignored his rapidly paling complexion in the face of her unrestrained anger. She felt her mana pulsing in her veins, begging to be used.</p><p>“No, wait, I-”</p><p>“It seems there is some misunderstanding about my upbringing in the temple. Do not worry, Lamprecht. It will be my pleasure to <em>re-educate </em> you about your <em> misconceptions. </em>”</p><p>The following beat down she submitted to him felt more relieving than she would have expected – seeing someone who used that cursed phrase squirm beneath her feet still felt oh so satisfying. She could not help herself but thoroughly enjoy the moment as she reminisced about similar instances in the past.</p><p>“How does it feel being subjected to three of the divine blessings, Lamprecht?”</p><p>Her relationship with the Gods may have been complicated, but channeling their power in a fight was as natural as breathing to her at this point. His shifting attention, however, was souring her barely improved mood again, it seemed even more lecturing was needed. She increased the pressure on his throat until his eyes were looking at her again.</p><p>“Pray to the Gods that you may never be forced to witness it again, Lamprecht. After all, the thorns of Efflorelume can cut deeper than any blade made of wind. Be glad I never served in any…role of your description. Also, never-”</p><p>She leaned slightly closer, putting more pressure on his wound and throat as she looked directly into his trembling eyes, pausing for dramatic effect.</p><p>“-dare to call me a temple flower – former or otherwise – again. Understood?”</p><p>He did his best to nod at her. Still, there was one more lesson she needed to teach him.</p><p>“Good. Oh, by the way, Lamprecht, did you know people have the tendency to reveal their true thoughts in different states of mind? Like under the influence of Vantole, or high amounts of anger or stress. Do you know there is another state of mind where they reveal their true self?”</p><p>She let an evil smile bloom on her face.</p><p>“It's when someone experiences true terror, or the state of being afraid of something or someone to an unreasonable degree. Tell me, are you terrified of me now… <em>Lamprecht?”</em></p><p>His frantical nodding would do for now.</p><p>“…A shame, I had such high hopes from the grandson of my Master. Please be assured that I will treat you with every ounce of respect you <em> deserve </em>. If you prove your worth to me, I will be glad to have you work under my direction in Lord Wilfried’s entourage, but if you disappoint my expectations again…”</p><p>She heard a faint whimper, assuring her that her message had come across. She just hoped he would learn from his mistakes.</p><p>“I guess we will see how Dregarnuhr spins.”</p><p>Afterwards she healed his wounds before making her way back to Bonifatius. The following argument and fight with her former laundered noble father was more exhilarating than her previous fight, but she could not help but notice that she did not need to use any battlesong to rival him either. Was Bonifatius truly that much above in skill compared to even his own family? Her mood took another dive, she missed her dear Hannelore so much… Maybe she should try teaching Angelica a battlesong after she gave her name to her? It was outside of Angelica’s normal skill set to sing extensively, but being engulfed in Rozemyne’s mana should theoretically allow her to use them, just like for her other namesworn in the last weave. She mused that it would not hurt to try in the future.</p><p>Still, she had to deal with an overgrown child first. She let out a tired sigh before making her way over towards the waiting audience, doing her best to keep her thoughts hidden behind her usual noble smile.</p><p>…Why was Sylvester now trying to hide behind Elvira? She kind of pitied her former noble mother for the situation she was stuck in. Her face spoke volumes about her thoughts, she was doing the noble equivalent of rolling her eyes with the strained smile she wore. Still she decided to ignore Sylvester's childish behavior, simply taking a knee before the strange duo and offering her greetings.</p><p>“You honor me with your presence at my first duel, Aub Ehrenfest. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous-”</p><p>“Ah, uhm, that’s alright. You may rise, simply act like I am not here.”</p><p>She had to use all of her control not to look at Sylvester in exasperation.</p><p>“I beg your pardon, Aub? I was just attempting to honor Gebordnung by offering you-”</p><p>“Do not mind me, I am not here. Aub’s order!”</p><p>“…As you command.”</p><p>She simply stood up. The awkward silence was uncomfortable, so she expressed her well wishes to Elvira for her husband, the knight commander, and took her leave as fast as possible.</p><p>After just a couple days of mundane life, Rozemyne was completely surprised by her mother when she suddenly proposed some practical attendant lessons for her a few days later. Attendant lessons, of all things… Even if they would be mostly worthless considering her plans for the future, she still decided to humor her beloved mother. It was in the end just more time spent with her and her big sister after all. Maybe it would come in handy somewhere? Plus, that meant another day when she could skip embroidery practice altogether – those days were rather common thanks to her busy schedule of work and training, but she was not complaining. In the end, the lesson with her mother surprised her. Still seeing how much stuff she had to remember and know about simply to serve someone was a slight eye opener for her. It was just more proof that her retainers were <em> all </em> excellent.  </p><p>Another happy occurrence was when Lieseleta finally became her attendant again. She transferred the duty of caring for her cute Hisui to her, seeing as the small cat-like feybeast seemingly took a liking to the green haired girl near instantly. Lieseleta’s conflicted expression after witnessing her pet's cuteness despite Hisui not being a shumil was so worth it! Gretia and Lieseleta blushed the most adorable colors when she openly praised them for their talents and seamless integration in her service later that day. Then there was Angelica…  </p><p>“Lady Mathilde, this is Angelica. I have finished my namestone, and I am ready to present it to Lady Rozemyne. Please tell me when she is available!” </p><p>The exasperation on Mathilde’s face was clear to see when she received the Ordonnanz. It was surprising to hear from Angelica this soon. As far as Rozemyne was aware, the term at the Royal Academy was not over yet. Had Angelica seriously gathered the required materials and rushed back as soon as possible? She had to smile at her own thoughts. Why was she even asking herself that question? Of course she did.</p><p>“My, my, my. Angelica seems most eager to serve me. When do you think would be an appropriate moment to receive her visit, Mathilde?”</p><p>The older woman only sighed before considering their options.</p><p>“As busy as we currently are, today would be the best opportunity, Milady. But even when Angelica is as… eager as she is, a proper lady should always keep propriety in mind.”</p><p>“Indeed. My sister can be… overzealous. Please do not encourage her behavior, Milady.”</p><p>Mathilde and Lieseleta both had a point, but letting Angelica wait for even longer seemed kind of cruel at this point when she seemingly even returned just to present her name to her. The sooner this was dealt with, the sooner she would concentrate on trying to pass her classes rather than the name swearing.</p><p>“Please send a reply that I will await her arrival today. It may be against the norm, but I am willing to indulge her eagerness this one time. I confess it is simply too adorable to watch. I will make sure it does not become a habit.”</p><p>“You are much too lenient with your retainers already, Milady.”</p><p>Rozemyne averted her eyes. She could not really argue against it, but her retainers were so excellent, she wanted to spoil them occasionally.</p><p>“Ahem, be that as it may. Please send an Ordonnanz to Angelica to inform her of my decision, Mathilde.</p><p>“As you wish, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>She ignored Lieseleta's subtle sigh and the chastising tone of her grandmotherly head attendant. Instead she continued her review of the sixth year lessons of the scholar course that the message interrupted. The magic circle she was refreshing her memory on was most interesting in its usage in this book.</p><p>When it was time for Angelica’s arrival, the older girl practically stormed into the mansion, her eyes tracking her form like a wolfaniel on the hunt. The young knight apprentice wasted no time and knelt before her as fast as Steifebriese.</p><p>“My Lady, I have arrived. I have finished creating my namestone and am ready to present it to you. Please grant me the honor of accepting my name as soon as possible!”</p><p>She was so eager, in fact, that she forsook any form of noble greeting, much to the exasperation of everyone else. Rozemyne could only chuckle at her loyal apprentice knight’s actions when she saw that Lieseleta was staring daggers at her single minded older sister.</p><p>“Oh my, you truly are eager, are you not? Not even offering me a greeting. I will excuse it this time only, Angelica. Remember to not ignore Gebordnung like this again. Now please, stand up. Mathilde, Tuuliane, you may bear witness to Angelica’s dedication. Let us make our way to a more private place at once.”</p><p>After receiving confirmation to her orders, the four of them made their way to an adjacent room. She looked around, the room itself was just as she had instructed. A comfortable looking chair and a small table, for tea and snacks for herself. She took her place in the chair, her sister placing the teaset she carried on the table before beginning to serve her. At this point, her beloved sister's tea was rivaling Fran’s. Angelica stared at her with startling intensity… Was she waiting for a command?</p><p>“You may now offer your namestone to me, Angelica.”</p><p>“Thank you, my Lady!”</p><p>Was it wrong for her to find the sheer happiness on Angelica’s face as she swore her life away into Rozemyne’s hands slightly disturbing? To her luck, none of her dark thoughts were apparent on her face as she watched her loyal apprentice knight kneel before her, Mathilde standing now slightly to the side, just watching. Angelica took out the intricate box containing her namestone before placing it prominently on the ground before her. She closed her eyes, arms crossed and bowed her head before speaking in a steady voice.</p><p>“I, Angelica, swear to serve as Lady Rozemyne’s sword and shield forever. May you wield me however you see fit.”  </p><p>After finishing her short vow Angelica took the intricate box into her hands before offering it for her to take. Rozemyne took the box into her hands with as much delicacy as she could muster. When she opened the lid, she saw the small stone for the first time. The beautiful piece had Angelica’s name written in bold, golden letters on it, resembling flames. The ultimate proof of loyalty any noble could offer to someone. As disturbing as it always was to think about, she could not help herself but feel disproportionately touched. It felt so nostalgic to hold such an innocent looking stone again, just like all the others she held in the past. Ironically, she never held Angelica’s name before, despite the steadfast loyalty she showed towards her in the past. Yet, it reminded her of the others all the same, if only for a short moment. Roderick, Matthias, Laurenz, Gretia, Hartmut, Clarissa, even Muriella. And of course she could not forget the moment when she first held her two most cherished namestones in her hands. Even if the memory carried the shock she felt when Hannelore and Lestilaut boldly offered their names to her together, swearing to not let anything come between them, beside death.</p><p>Her mind drifted as her honest smile grew slightly, remembering those times. She took a few more moments to inspect the stone before placing it back into the box.</p><p>“Everything seems in order. My Father told me that the process of dyeing the stone in my mana would be painful for you, so please prepare yourself, Angelica. I will finish the process as fast as possible.”</p><p>She looked up as she spoke and noticed that Angelica was snapping out of some sort of trance? Strange.</p><p>“Ah! Thank you for the warning, my Lady. Do not mind me, please mark me as yours forever!”</p><p>…Did Angelica not realise how sexual such a declaration sounded? Mathilde was staring at her wide eyed now. Rozemyne had to suppress a blush before deciding to ignore this fact. She began to push her mana into the box, starting the process.</p><p>“Hnnnngh!”</p><p>Angelica let out a strangled noise before starting to tremble. When Rozemyne pushed more mana into the box to speed up the process, she watched with worry as Angelica began to desperately gasp for breath, using her arms to keep her head off the ground. She was nearly falling over when the trembles began to intensify, more resembling twitches now. Rozemyne stood up from her seat in her worry. Those alarming signs were a more intense reaction than she was used to, but luckily it was over soon enough. The cocoon felt warm in her hand as Angelica shakily got back into her previous kneeling position while Rozemyne caressed her most valuable new possession while sitting down again. </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">“I can feel your magnificent mana caressing my body, my Lady. It feels quite good to be honest! Does that mean I can finally serve you now?”</p><p>“…Yes, you now <em> belong to me </em>, Angelica. I pray I did not hurt you too much when dyeing your namestone?”</p><p>The uncensored look of pure bliss on Angelica’s face made her previous statement even more suggestive. And were her eyes sparkling now?</p><p>“YES! I have waited too long for this! Please use me as you wish, Lady Rozemyne. I look forward to not having to think in my future anymore!”</p><p>She looked sternly at her innuendo spouting apprentice knight.</p><p>“You still have to graduate from the Royal Academy first, Angelica. So you still need to think for yourself for quite some time.”</p><p>The blue haired airhead paled rapidly before assuming a begging pose, tears gathering in the corner of her eyes! It was frankly too adorable to look at!</p><p>“Please save me from those lessons, Milady! I know I am not good at thinking, but you can still make use of everything else of me however you wish. I beg you to help me graduate!”</p><p>Rozemyne blushed slightly at those words, she knew that it was not meant that way. Obviously. But looking at her pretty apprentice knight's figure – with her developing curves – on the floor, kneeling before her as she begged gave her some ideas that would surely earn her more than simple chastisement from Mathilde if they were voiced.</p><p>“Angelica, that is no way to speak to our Lady! How shameless can you be?!”</p><p>Mathilde’s outraged shout caused said girl to cower slightly before her, the hurt look on her face made her look even more adorable. Rozemyne's finger twitched as she desperately tried to regain her declining composure.</p><p>“I do not care if I am shameless! I desperately need help to graduate! I barely got through those hard lessons so far, I am doomed without our radiant Lady’s guidance! How can I faithfully serve and protect her when I fail at the Royal Academy? I beg you to please save me, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>“How can you struggle at the Royal Academy already, Angelica? As far as I am aware, you are only learning the rudimentary knowledge of what a noble should know. The coursework of the specialized professions is only for the next year. It will become <em> much </em> harder in your third year. Was I wrongly informed about the curriculum, Mathilde?”</p><p>Her head attendant shook her head.</p><p>“You were not, Milady. The first two years only cover the basics one needs to know. The material will become more difficult in even the normal lessons when you begin to take specialized courses to decide your future career in your third.”</p><p>Angelica looked at both of them as if she had just received her death sentence. Tears were pouring from her eyes in startling quantities before she suddenly threw herself at Rozemyne’s feet in desperation. </p><p>“Nooooo! Milady, please save me from those evil lessons. I will do anything you ask of me!”</p><p>The opportunity to tease her was just too good to pass up.</p><p>“Oh my, I could always order you by name to learn and think more for your lessons now, can I not?”</p><p>Angelica’s head jolted upwards, her face showing her despair.</p><p>“Please no! I beg you to show mercy for your useless servant!”</p><p>Rozemyne could not resist the temptation any longer and began to pet Angelica’s head affectionately. Her actions seemed to calm the older girl down if her leaning into her touch was any indication.</p><p>“Do not worry, I was only jesting. Of course I will do my best to support you now that you are in my care. Also please remember that I will not allow you to call yourself useless from now on. You <em> belong to me </em> now, after all. It simply will not do for you to fail in the Royal Academy. I take care of those serving me faithfully.”</p><p>“My Lady…”</p><p>Even more tears began to pour from Angelica’s face, but at least her expression turned into a beautiful smile. One of her true smiles, she assumed. Angelica closed her eyes in bliss, seemingly enjoying Rozemyne's attention. It was only when Mathilde's subtle cough caught her attention that she stopped petting Angelica’s head.</p><p>“But enough of that. Let us return to the others.”</p><p>After her words everyone began to make their way back into her chambers. Angelica followed her on her left side in obvious happiness at finally being able to guard her.</p><p>“Milady, welcome back.”</p><p>She nodded at Gretia and the others. Normally she would use her downtime to read, but it would be best to begin solving Angelica’s troubles as fast as possible. She sat down into her comfy chair and indicated for Angelica to remain in her sight.</p><p>“As touched as I am that you decided to give your name to me, it seems we now need to solve your struggles at the Royal Academy so that you can finish your education with aplomb. Tell me what are your main problems?”</p><p>Rozemyne was then confronted with the same explanation as in the last weave, only without the exasperation about her not understanding the knight coursework – seeing that she was still in her second year and did not have them yet – but to hear her struggling already was kind of worrying.</p><p>“I will help you to prepare for the coming years.”</p><p>Angelica looked at her with hope in her eyes.</p><p>“But only if you get good grades this year.”</p><p>The hope in her eyes was snuffed out immediately. She fell to her knees in a startling repeat of their earlier conversation.</p><p>“Milady, please show mercy! You said you were only jesting earlier!”</p><p>Rozemyne decided this was as good an opportunity to confront her with the mehren and stick approach.</p><p>“I cannot help you If you cannot prove to me your willingness to improve yourself. If you reach that goal, I am even willing to give you some of my mana for your manablade.”</p><p>She was not prepared for Angelica using enhancement magic to kneel directly before her while taking her hands into her own!</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Angelica was apparently moved to tears by her promise. She bowed her head and took her hand, pressing it gently against her forehead.</p><p>“I cannot thank you enough for the favor and grace you are showing me.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled down softly at her until Angelica raised her head again. She was taken aback by the expression she saw. Angelica was now looking at her with fervent devotion, as if seeing the Goddess of Light’s crown on top of Rozemyne’s head. She freed her hand from Angelica’s grip and began to gently pet her head again, much to the older girl's obvious delight as she closed her eyes and subtly moved a little bit into her touch again.</p><p>“<em>I believe in you, Angelica</em>. I know you will live up to my expectations. Let us look forward to the day of your return from the Royal Academy with good grades so I can reward you for your efforts.</p><p>“Yes! Thank you, Milady! I will not disappoint you!!!”</p><p>Seeing that her actions made her loyal apprentice knight so happy was simply heartwarming. After that interaction Angelica enjoyed the rest of the day guarding her before making her way back to her home, with the promise to meet her tomorrow. Just in time too as there was still much to prepare.</p><p>The first morning heading to the children’s playroom after Angelica’s name dedication was… interesting. Tuuliane and Lieseleta helped her get ready in a nice dress – nicer than usual, but they insisted on “practicing” with complex outfits – and a carriage was prepared for her and her three attendants after breakfast. While it was already nearing the end of winter, it was still a particularly harsh day, with strong winds and heavy snow, making the preparations take longer.</p><p>They bundled up in thick coats and were on their way to the four seater carriage when Rozemyne sensed a presence approaching them rapidly from the sky. She was ready to defend the retainers around her from the mysterious attack, enhancing her eyes to find the attacker in the distance. As soon as her eyes landed on the figure, she let down her guard with an annoyed sigh, and simply waited outside in the storm as Angelica hopped off her highbeast in front of her.</p><p>“My Lady, I came to guard you!”</p><p>Her newly namesworn apprentice knight knelt in front of her, covered in so much snow that only her frosty face was visible. At that moment, she wasn’t sure if she should consider the extra day Angelica was spending in Ehrenfest before returning to the Academy a good choice or a bad one.</p><p>“I can see that, Angelica. Although I do not understand why you would come here in this storm when you were supposed to meet us in the playroom.”</p><p>Angelica’s eyes widened slightly, her expression reverting to her usual innocent look she used if she wanted to avoid receiving a scolding.</p><p>“But then you would be unprotected on the way there. The snow did get everywhere, though… I did not expect it to be this messy.”</p><p>Angelica shook her head to get rid of the snow clinging to her hair. The sight was strangely adorable, Rozemyne had to stop herself from reaching out to pat her again like she’d done Hannelore’s wolfaniels in Dunkelfelger. Her guard knight looked so much like the animal when she was chastised. The others tried to take a step back to avoid being hit by the snow, but all of them were too slow to react. Rozemyne could have reacted fast enough to avoid it, but she chose to face the snow head on as penance for not stopping Angelica before things got to that point. Besides, they were already standing in a snow storm. It would not make that much of a difference.</p><p>“Sister! You are getting Lady Rozemyne dirty! Besides, you will get sick if you fly in the storm without proper protection against the cold!”</p><p>“I did not forget protection! Mother has embroidered magic circles on my undergarments, no cold or snow can penetrate them!”</p><p>Rozemyne had to avert her eyes as her thoughts drifted towards the implications of this statement. Did her loveable apprentice knight truly not realize what she just said? She noticed that the others were staring at Angelica with similar reactions to herself. She decided to simply ignore it and get on with it.</p><p>“Let us get in the carriage, we will all get sick if we are delayed much longer.”</p><p>“Uhm, Milady… I’m afraid we did not anticipate Angelica joining us this morning… The carriage fits only four, and there is no time to prepare a larger one.”</p><p>“Angelica will just have to follow us on her highbeast, then.”</p><p>Angelica for her part was just in the process of standing up before she looked at her like a kicked puppy after Gretia’s comment.</p><p>“But my Lady! That would leave you too vulnerable! I have to insist that I protect you from inside the carriage. Don’t worry, I’m sure I’ll fit. I do very well in tight spaces!”</p><p>A few minutes and plenty of defeated sighs later, the carriage was on the way to the castle, with Tuuliane and Gretia sitting on the bench facing the back of the carriage with strained noble smiles, and a very happy Angelica squeezed between Lieseleta and Rozemyne on the other. The air was quite heavy with tension as Lieseleta stared daggers into her oblivious sister, and Rozemyne could do nothing but stare out the window. Despite traveling through the noble district, the carriage shook with the constant assault of the snow, and the wind was nearly tossing them from one wall to the other. It sure would have been nice to have a boarding type highbeast or at least the suspension system they invented in the last weave…</p><p>Rozemyne sighed and gave up her view of the window, which was not showing much through the snow anyways, and gave into the temptation to lean her head against Angelica’s shoulder instead. Angelica didn’t seem to react to it, likely deciding that Rozemyne would tell her if this was something she needed to think about, but Tuuliane’s and Gretia’s eyebrows raised slightly.</p><p>“Carriage rides sure are inconvenient…”</p><p>“They are quite boring, but at least they keep us warm and protected from the weather.”</p><p>“Highbeasts are so much faster! And they can go even faster with more mana, you would probably already be at the castle with your mana, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>That was true, but she could not really use her highbeast with her current dress. And she did not want to officially invent the boarding type yet. Plus, it wasn’t like she could have made it in secret after her father “teaching” her how to make one personally just a few days prior…</p><p>At the end of their regular training session, he signaled for her to stay, and with a dramatic flare presented her with a highbeast feystone. Her improvised one was on the verge of turning into dust, so the timing felt too good to be a coincidence, but she did her best to dismiss that thought from her mind. Her father encouraged her to try to create a couple shapes at least while with him on the training grounds, so she tried her best to show at least some difficulty for the first few steps. However, she dyed the stone in mere seconds, and after the many years of using a highbeast in high stress situations, the best she managed with her “struggle” was to execute the steps slower than her usual speed but still flawlessly. Her dad watched her with that loveable if stupidly proud grin on his face.</p><p>“Just what I expected from my genius daughter, you got the first steps down with no trouble at all!”</p><p>She kept her grumbling to herself about how pretending to be learning something so basic was causing her plenty of trouble, and tried to put on a happy smile. Maybe she should have shown even more difficulty? Well, too late to think about it now.</p><p>“Thank you, Father!”</p><p>When it came for her to choose a form, she blanked for a moment. Obviously she could not use Lessy again, and the adorable red panda did not really fit her image anymore. Not to mention she could live without the constant grun comparison. She needed an animal that she could fight on, now that she had mainly a knight persona to uphold. Something with wings. Something that represented her. An image suddenly plopped into her head, causing the stone to change to fit her fantasy before she could stop it.</p><p>“What in the-?”</p><p>Her father’s reaction was fitting as she looked at her finished creation. Standing before her was a car-sized blue raven.</p><p>“How did you know about Schwartzraben, dear daughter of mine? As far as I know this feybeast is extinct.”</p><p>Crap. How could she explain herself? Time to rely on the old classics.</p><p>“I read about it in a book inside the temple before my baptism.”</p><p>“Oh, that explains why it looks slightly different than the depiction in our bookroom. For a moment I feared you already read the book depicting feybeasts with the darkness attribute. Most images are… slightly disturbing to look at. It would be best if you read it when you're a little bit older.”</p><p>At least her lie worked without problems. But she had so many questions now.</p><p>“Does it look different? The book just described it roughly without much detail, to be honest.”</p><p>Her dad walked around her formed highbeast, inspecting it thoroughly before stopping at her side.</p><p>“If you want to form a Schwartzrabe, you need to add six smaller eyes. Also make the beak a little bit sharper looking. Hmm, the color is also wrong, but that is to be expected considering it's dyed by your mana.”</p><p>So it had multiple eyes like a Ternisbefallen? Rozemyne thought about the changes her father suggested, aside from the color. She was a little alarmed when the attempt to change its form took much more mana than she had expected.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock when her Highbeast not only grew six more eyes in addition to its two main ones but changed its color into a deep black too. She had not even tried for this to happen. But all of that paled in comparison to the events that happened right after.</p><p>“CAW!”</p><p>Her Highbeast came to life on its own?! It was flapping its wings, cawing in a deep baritone sound that resonated in her whole body. Its eyes began to search its close vicinity before one of them landed on her form, causing every other eye to hone on her as well. Both her father and herself tensed up when her ‘highbeast’ turned in their direction before stopping before her and began to… bow?</p><p>Rozemyne did not know how else to describe it. Her sentient highbeast was currently bowing in submission to her. Its eyes fixated on her own. She felt like in a trance as she stepped up before she gave into her sudden desire to pet its beak. Her petting resulted in a low humming sound to be emitted from the deathly bird before her.</p><p>“Nyx.”   </p><p>Everything happening was too absurd to her to question anything at this point. Her new highbeast was sentient and called Nyx. She had stranger things happen to her. It was a world of magic after all.</p><p>“By the Gods…” </p><p>Yeah, her father was most likely right. Those incompetent Gods were the most likely culprits to blame for this. But what did she care about that right now? She had a sentient highbeast that looked like an extinct darkness attribute feybeast, how cool was that?</p><p>Nyx…</p><p>To her father’s great relief, however, once she stopped supplying mana, Nyx turned back into a highbeast stone. It dropped to the ground as if nothing had happened. Forming her again also took no more mana than her old Lessy did at that size, though the strange behaviour remained, no matter how many times she tried to conjure Nyx as a normal, non-sentient highbeast…</p><p>At least she listened to orders immediately, including simply ordering her to silence, and worked perfectly as a highbeast when she flew a small circle around her slightly panicked father. Explaining the events of the afternoon to her mother was a whole different story, however…</p><p>Her fingers started to play with the highbeast stone on her belt subconsciously at the memories. The cold stone against her skin pulled her back from Schlaftraum’s realm, and she remembered they were still having a conversation. Eventually, she decided to reply to Angelica’s earlier words.</p><p>“That might be true, but it would also be inconvenient having to change when Tuuliane, Lieseleta and Gretia spent so long preparing me.”</p><p>“Indeed, you will have to remember that you can’t use your highbeast in a dress, Sister. You will still need to take the carriage with me when we attend tea parties, for example.”</p><p>Angelica moved slightly more into Rozemyne – to her hidden delight – trying to distance herself from Lieseleta as if that would save her from her words.</p><p>“Noooo! But carriage rides with you are so boring! You always lecture me the whole way!”</p><p>Before the conversation could turn into another argument between the sisters, Rozemyne cleared her throat to catch their attention – which was not hard as her head was still resting on Angelica’s shoulder.</p><p>“I have not had the chance to attend many tea parties yet, especially not with other children. How did you find them?”</p><p>“Very boring, My Lady.”</p><p>Why was she even trying to involve Angelica in this conversation? At least her shoulder was very comfortable to rest her head on.</p><p>“They have been good opportunities to gather intelligence, but I’m afraid we also haven’t had many chances to interact with children our age at tea parties, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Yeah, only Lady Brunhilde and Lady Leonore are around Lieseleta’s age, and they just talk to each other usually.”</p><p>“They have been close since before their baptism, they rarely include us in their conversation aside from basic courtesy and the occasional mention of other noble ladies’ romance stories.”</p><p>Rozemyne faintly remembered that Leonore and Brunhilde were close to each other even before entering her service in the last weave. Still, it was news to her that they talked about romance of all things.</p><p>“Romance stories? Such as?”</p><p>“Oh, ehm… It has been a while since they shared anything noteworthy with us… I believe the last we heard was Lady Brigitte of Illgner exchanging engagement stones with Lord Hassheit, right, Angelica?”</p><p>“Lady… Brigitte…? Oh right, she’s a knight! She’s very good with a spear.”</p><p>Angelica nodded with enthusiasm to Lieseleta’s question – despite not actually answering what was asked of her, but Lieseleta just continued her explanation smoothly after her initial uncertainty.</p><p>“We were told the ceremony was quite sweet. Lord Hassheit promised to support Illgner to the best of his abilities when he proposed to Lady Brigitte. Oh, Lady Brigitte is the younger sister of Giebe Illgner, so she wished for a match to support her brother. But that’s not exactly interesting, my apologies.”</p><p>“Is that so? How fortunate for Illgner.”</p><p>Rozemyne responded absent-mindedly, trying to remember the timeline from her last weave. It was so long ago… but she was quite certain Brigitte had already disgraced herself by cancelling her engagement by this time. Sounded like this time things actually progressed to the formal engagement. Perhaps this weave was different enough to give her a happy marriage without all that trouble…</p><p>“I don’t know why Lady Brigitte would want to do that when she won’t be a knight anymore after her starbinding… That’s why I will never be binding my starts to anyone! You are all I need, Milady!”</p><p>She had to suppress a slight blush, playing it off as if it was not bothering her to hear it. That was just like a direct confession! The wide eyed looks of the others did not help in her situation. Angelica was still being scolded by them all when they arrived at the castle but more for her choice of words stating she did not intend to marry…</p>

    <p>
  <span>When they arrived at the castle, they did not waste much time seeking shelter inside. The snowstorm outside was getting stronger. Rozemyne wondered how long it would take for the Knight’s Order to take down the Lord of Winter this year. The mighty Schnesturm would surely prove a challenge for them without her one-shotting it with the spear of Leidenschaft to gather the materials for her Jureve. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced at the others as they shook the snow out of their hair, and after giving their coats to a nearby servant they began making their way to the playroom. The giddy expression on Angelica’s face reminded her about something though. So she redirected them into one of the private rooms adjacent to the playroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My, I just remembered there was something I needed to do first. Angelica.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Milady?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Angelica’s eyes focused on her own in mere seconds, her eager expression was simply adorable to look at.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is the matter of you serving me now, I prefer to keep this matter discreet for a little bit longer. I would guess you would want to guard me whenever you can, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing would make me happier, Milady!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would be sad to see the pale blue haired girl's hopes torn to shreds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see. In that case, I need to speak with Lady Veronica about some matters first. Also, this will make this a good first experience for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The others looked at her in slight confusion at her words. But their eyes widened when she took Angelica’s namestone into her hand. She began channeling her mana into the stone to reinforce the command she was about to give. Angelica’s face showed her surprise before she shuddered slightly. She wrapped her arms around herself, emitting a strange sound that sounded like a… whimper? Without any further prompting she dropped to kneel before Rozemyne, readjusting her arms to the usual crossed posture indicating subservience.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Angelica, you will not reveal or indicate that you swore your name to me in any form until I say otherwise. Should someone question you about this topic, you will do your best to avoid or change the topic without giving anything about your loyalty to me away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you command, Mistress!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘How strange for her to address me like this suddenly. Is it the influence of my mana for the command?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne stopped channeling her mana into the namestone before returning it to its previous place inside of her hip-satchel. Silence reigned until it was broken when Angelica looked up at her with tears in her eyes. Oh, dear…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Milady, why did you give me that awful command? Are you ashamed of me as your guard knight? Please, give me a chance to prove myself. I swear I will not disappoint you! And that feeling… your mana is usually so pleasant, but just now it felt like my life would end! Why would you be so cruel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Angelica, an archnoble having a knight can send the wrong message if not revealed with careful planning. Are you saying you would not want to announce that you now serve me for all to hear, without my order?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As expected Angelica averted her eyes from her before assuming her usual stance and pose to avoid a scolding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- um. Well, maybe? But everyone should see that I now belong to you, Milady! You can trust me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will take that as a no, justifying my decision. It is not that I do not trust your loyalty, Angelica. But did you not wish for me to think instead of you? This way you do not have to think about what information to reveal and when – I will decide that for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her airheaded apprentice knight simply slumped in her posture before making an undignified sound again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ughh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“However, I had no intention of being cruel. The sensation you felt was simply the feeling of being commanded by name. Such a simple order should be the perfect opportunity to allow you to experience it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the day was uneventful, just as expected with her command. Angelica remained silent on the matter, and no one batted an eye on the older girl following her around like a guard dog. And truly, who would suspect anything with her sister Lieseleta now part of Rozemyne’s retinue? Angelica’s fascination with her was well known at this point anyways. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sadly, she had to leave everyone behind in the playroom when she made her way towards Wilfried’s chambers to give him another music lesson. Honestly she had expected much more resistance from him. She remembered his dislike of playing harspiel from the last weave, getting him to at least fulfill the minimum expected of him was like pulling teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne arrived in the East Wing with a little bit of time to spare, nodding at the knight positioned outside Wilfried’s door. His name was Heinrich – a mednoble of the Veronica faction – if she remembered right, Lamprecht’s old second in command. He simply nodded at her in respect before opening the door for her to allow her entry into the rooms beyond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, you are a little bit early, Niece. I hope you fared well in this terrible weather and the playroom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave her usual polite smile in Oswald’s direction before replying to her uncle. It still felt strange to her to call him that in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was no trouble at all, Uncle. Ewigeliebe shall be no barrier for Erwachlehren. Is Lord Wilfried still busy with his other lessons?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed he is. But he will be finished with them soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oswald nodded at one of the other attendants, who nodded back before leaving to fetch the harspiel she was provided with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say Uncle, could I ask you to be Ordoschnelli to Lady Veronica, requesting a meeting for me? There are some things I need to talk with her about regarding our Lord’s entourage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone in her vicinity, including Oswald, froze at her words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- Yes, that should not prove to be a problem, dear niece. May I inquire what you need to speak with her about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is for Lady Veronica’s ears only. Surely Anhaltung needs not to grace Ordoschnelli with the Supreme Couple’s woes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Strangely, he looked as if he had bitten on something sour before regaining his composure. A quick glance around revealed that everyone was looking at her with scared looks now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. Of course. Nevermind my question, I will send word at once.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you very much, Uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before anything else could be said, they were interrupted by an excited shout from the adjacent room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rozemyne is here already?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could not help but level a blank stare in Oswalds direction. They had talked at length about Wilfried’s lacking manners. That there was still no real progress being made was technically not her problem, as she was only required to teach him about music. Still, it was hard to maintain her noble bearing when she wanted to simply shake or hold her head constantly at his refusal to learn anything not related to knights or herself. Well, it was really just one topic – seeing as she was his head-knight – so it was not that surprising really. Oswald, for his part, swallowed before giving her a look that practically screamed for her to show him mercy. Too bad she had none to give.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see that Lord Wilfried’s struggles with receiving Erwachlehren’s guidance have not become better at all. I just hope at least Grammaratur will grant him her blessing soon. Seeing the lack of progress in everything except his developing talents in Kunstzeal’s domain is most… concerning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least they had the decency to lower their heads at her scolding. Seriously, what were they doing? Before anything else could be said, Wilfried charged into the room heading straight towards her, only slowing his approach after seeing her blank look in his direction. Apparently it was effective, as he stopped before her and just waited for her to give him a greeting. It was some progress at least. She gave a simple seasonal greeting with just a bow to finish since she could act more informal with him as a retainer now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am honored that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together once again under Ewigeliebe's harsh judgement, Lord Wilfried. May I inquire if you are ready for your lessons?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Let’s start right away!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had to suppress a tired sigh at this response, and instead just gestured for them to take their seats. At least he showed steady progress. He would never be a good harspiel player but at this rate he would at least not fail in his debut. Which was in essence everything that was expected from her to do until then. His enthusiasm was at least getting him through the entire lesson without trying to run away. She decided that rewarding his efforts with singing the song for him again was good for positive reinforcement – seeing as he liked it so much. At the end of the lesson, after she sang one song to Wilfried’s delight, she handed her instrument back to a nearby attendant and prepared to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This will be all for today, my Lord. You did much better than last time. At this rate you will have no trouble at your debut if you keep working hard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ignored her praise, instead surprising her with a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait a moment, please. Um, say, you are really blessed by Kunstzeal and Grammaratur, Rozemyne. Do you practise often too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do indeed, my Lord. Most of the blessings of the Gods require constant practice to not fall out of their favor. I practice the arts at least two times a week. More, if my schedule allows for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He seemed to brighten at her response, now wearing a happy smile on his face as he continued his questioning. Was he trying to make smalltalk with her?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you take lessons in anything else? Like, have you learned to read yet? Or do you take lessons in training? You will take Lamprecht’s place after my debut, right? So are you good at fighting, right?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my, Lord Wilfried, Verbergen shrouds a Lady for a reason. I am sure you recall when we discussed that a Lady does not outright answer a question unless she benefits from it, so you should dance with Grammaratur more gently to allow her to reply indirectly. Of course, matters relating to the domain of Leidenschaft are easier discussed with knights in your employ, but you should still take care while I am only your Erwachlehren. You would not wish to be thought of as Elbberg pining after Verfuhremeer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He frowned before looking at the ground for a short moment before speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I talk with my other retainers openly all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I am most regretful to bring you such bitter melodies, but it seems they still continue to fail in their duty to be your Anhaltung on these matters. Also, there is the difference of our gender. You are a Lord, meanwhile I am a Lady, there is simply a difference in how to talk and approach each other that you need to be aware of and follow, lest you make any mistakes. Verbergen can only conceal potential missteps while you are hidden from prying eyes in the castle. After your debut, he won’t be able to stop errant Ordoschnelli from flying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilfried looked at her with a slightly stubborn look now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But will I then not have you at my side at that point? You will become my knight, not just my teacher like right now!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As I said, it will be somewhat easier to speak of the matters in Leidenschaft’s domain – that is, matters related to me serving as your knight. But a knight is not supposed to openly guide, or even worse, teach their master in simple matters like that. That is what your attendants, scholars and teachers are for, my Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne raised an eyebrow at his flabbergasted look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S- Simple? You call how you can speak </span>
  <em>
    <span>simple?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is indeed a simple matter, Lord Wilfried. I am currently refraining from using some of the more esoteric phrases in the dance of Grammaratur. I deeply apologize if that was insulting to you in any way. Shall I speak less openly from now on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“NO! I mean, no, it is fine how you speak right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well. As I said, it is not my place to teach you this, Lord Wilfried. I will simply guard you from harm, or slay your enemies at your command. I am neither your scholar nor attendant, and I teach you only music until your debut. To do any more would not only overstep my place, but it would mark your other teachers as incompetent in the eyes of noble society, and stain your reputation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His reaction brought her back how she herself struggled with the euphemistic speech of nobles for the longest time in her past. At this point, she was so used to it that it required more effort of her to speak plainly. How ironic this reversal was in hindsight. Still, this conversation was more entertaining than she would have expected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“However… Why don’t you try to ask me your question again, in a less direct manner, and I shall consider answering.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His expression morphed to something resembling determination even if she could see tiny beads of sweat forming on his temple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Erm… Since you will be my head knight after my debut, uhm, why don’t you tell me about your experience in… Leidenschaft’s domain?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My, if I didn’t know better, I might think you were mocking me, suggesting that I don’t have any experience with so much hesitation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked so sad that even his best attempt could not convey his true meaning in a noble manner, so she decided to throw him a bone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I am sure such nuance will come with practice. I do have plenty of experience in Leidenschaft’s domain, my Lord, I train regularly and think of myself as adequate in combat. There is still much for me to learn until I can equal my Master, but I look forward to it. Aside from lessons, I also spend some time with my pet, Hisui, that Schlagziel blessed me with. She is quite smart and adorable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you have a pet? Can I see it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nearly blinked at the question. She had not expected he would show interest in her adorable little Hisui.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that is your desire, I can bring her with me tomorrow? She is not shy, but I must warn you that she is still a zantze. They can be quite ferocious if not handled correctly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you said she is smart, so she obeys you, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She does. There was no trouble so far and, she obeys any order I give her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, then bring her tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne looked around them, most of them looked at her even more scared than before. Was having a zantze as a pet that much of a deal? Hisui was cute though…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you wish, Lord Wilfried. I will bring Hisui with me tomorrow. Be sure to look forward to your harspiel lesson – I am sure you will not let the presence of my pet detract from your hard work in Kunstzeals’ domain. However, it seems Dregarnuhr spun our thread with exceptional speed today. May I be excused? I still need to return to the playroom after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilfried's mood seemed to take a slight dip before he gave his assent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the day was fairly uneventful until she told her parents that she would be taking her pet to see Wilfried. Her mother had the most vocal reaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You cannot be serious, Rozemyne. Even if we know that Hisui is tame, you can </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> take her with you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Mother, Lord Wilfried himself requested to see her. I did not even suggest anything. Should I refuse to bring her after he practically ordered me to bring her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Roselinde struggled to find any way to avoid bringing a feybeast into the castle. It was understandable, but as Rozemyne stated before, she could not disobey a direct order from the Aub’s son without grave consequences.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our Rozemyne has a firm grip on her pet, Roselinde. Simply trust her. It is not as if a small zantze is even that much of a danger anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother sent an angry look at dad before sighing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. But do take care that Hisui does not attack Lord Wilfried in any way. I don't even want to think about the consequences should that happen…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promise, Mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next day was still as stormy as the one before, but at least Angelica had now returned back to the Royal Academy, giving them ample room in the carriage. Rozemyne busied herself with pampering her adorable Hisui with affection. As usual she responded especially well to scratches behind her ears, the purring was soothing to listen to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After arriving safely inside of the castle she turned around and gave her orders to her attendants.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will not join you in the playroom but will make my way directly to Lord Wilfried’s chambers. You may enjoy your time in the playroom without me today, short as it may be. I will see you all later when it is time to return.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne received their agreement before making her way into the east wing. Hisui had taken her usual place on her right shoulder, drawing many curious eyes to her as she walked towards her destination. When she entered the room, her “colleagues” stared at her and Hisui with those wary looks again. Ignoring them, she took her pet into her arms and began to whisper into her ear while channeling tiny amounts of mana into the feybeast. Hisui tensed up slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will now meet the one I am currently guarding. Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> show any form of hostility to the young boy about to meet us. I will neither allow nor forgive any form of aggression. You will show your most docile state to him, </span>
  <em>
    <span>understood?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mew!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave Hisui a pat on the head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good girl. There will be a reward too if you behave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They did not have to wait long for Wilfried to meet them. His whole schedule had changed with her need to make an early visit. Normally she would not be the first to give him lessons, but he ordered the changes to make sure he could have fun with the “cool pet”, and his retainers did everything to please the heir of Aub Ehrenfest, of course. At least no one was expecting her to “fix” him completely this time. It was a small relief. He just barely held himself back to allow Rozemyne to give her greetings, but he did not waste a moment more than necessary, looking at her adorable Hisui with sparkling eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So this is your pet?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, my Lord. This is my pet zantze, Hisui. I offer my deepest apologies if my language today may be more crude than normally. I did not have the opportunity to train her to understand more sophisticated commands yet. I need to be fairly direct when giving her any commands or speaking to her in general.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waved his hands as if dismissing her apology entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay. I do not mind it in the slightest. So she even knows commands? That’s so cool! Show me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne gave a polite nod before gently placing Hisui at the ground. The small Feybeast turned to look at her as if awaiting a command. She was so adorable!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hisui, this is Lord Wilfried, the one I am guarding. Be a good girl and be nice to him from now on. Now, do three spins and sit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smart feline obeyed her without hesitation, sitting at attention after doing the spins as instructed. Wilfried seemed quite happy to see it, if his expression was any indication.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> cool! And does she obey any command you give her? Can I pet her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She does. You may pet her to your heart's content.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilfried hesitantly lowered himself to pet Hisui on the head. After seeing that his gestures were receiving a positive response, his expression brightened even more, his movements being filled with his usual confidence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you can see, my little Hisui is quite the darling. Still, I need to ask if you desire to play a little bit more with her or would you prefer that we start your usual harspiel lessons now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was kind of funny to see him so openly torn in indecision. Rozemyne decided to remain silent, awaiting his decision, and taking a short moment to look around the room instead to see the reactions of the other retainers. The scared looks had changed slightly, now resembling more wary apprehension. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be best to do the lesson first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you wish, Lord Wilfried. Hisui.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her pet got out from under Wilfried’s hands, jumping into Rozemyne’s arms before taking her usual place on her shoulder. The initial sad expression on the young boy's face changed to excitement again at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we then move to our usual seating arrangement?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lesson was slightly worse than the last one, but it was understandable as Wilfried’s attention occasionally shifted to her pet – who was still perched on her shoulder – instead of the notes before him. Instead of scolding him too much, she simply withheld offering to sing. The disappointment was easily forgotten though when he began to play with her pet again. It seemed that her Hisui was living up to her expectations – she behaved well, and aside from some slight narrowing of her eyes at the other staff around them, there was no incident whatsoever. Rozemyne was in the process of leaving when Wilfried made an unexpected inquiry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was even more fun than usual. Can you bring her regularly from now on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hesitated for a moment. Bringing Hisui with her already caused quite a stir, bringing her </span>
  <em>
    <span>every day</span>
  </em>
  <span> would be even more troublesome. Luckily, Oswald came to her rescue before she was forced to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would unnecessarily burden Rozemyne, my Lord. Not to mention that your progress suffered slightly from your split attention. May I suggest refraining from that avenue?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But when she is always here it will become normal, right? I just had so much fun with her. I want to see her more often!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dismissed Oswald’s advice before turning to Rozemyne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, bring Hisui here for those lessons from now on!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne for her part simply kneeled before Wilfried with her arms crossed and head slightly bowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will do as you command, Lord Wilfried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After she left his chambers she stopped at the door, seeing as she was still struck with the conundrum of how to solve this headache. On the other hand, it was a direct order, so could she truly be blamed for the consequences? To her surprise, it was Lamprecht of all people who exited behind her and looked at her with an expression resembling… pity? He offered her a silencing tool – the surprises kept on coming it seemed. She accepted the tool after some slight hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see you have received the first unreasonable order from our Lord. I know you do not have any choice but to bring your pet from now on until he grows bored of it. May I ask how you plan to deal with your required attendance in the playroom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I honestly do not know. Maybe I should just bring her there too? Should our Lord not grow bored of her until next year I am sure he would command her presence in the playroom anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lamprecht did not even try to hide his exasperation before giving a tired sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True. I know I acted out of place before, but may I suggest simply getting it over with and taking her with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may be right, thank you for attempting to act as Anhaltung.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Having Hisui by her side at all times was not as much of a bad idea as Lamprecht made it seem. She handed the sound blocking tool back with a pensive look and said her quick goodbye, pondering the future in the meanwhile. Hisui was already rather well trained, and while she was still small now, she would make quite a formidable guard one day. The request from Wilfried was unreasonable, yes, but she could work it to her benefit very well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She arrived at the playroom, ignoring the looks of everyone around her upon her entry. Unsurprisingly it was Lieseleta who was the first to hesitantly speak up in a hushed voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Milady, did you not say that you will not join us in the playroom today? You even bought Hisui with you, may I inquire what your intentions are now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne gave her reply in the same quiet voice to prevent the children around them from eavesdropping, but not concerned enough to use a magic tool.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Wilfried was quite taken by my Hisui. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>ordered</span>
  </em>
  <span> for her continued presence during his lessons. Avoiding the playroom entirely seems impractical, so I simply bought her with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave said feybeast a gentle pat on the head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hisui will be on her best behavior. Won’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mew!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such a good girl you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne gave her another pat before taking out a small feystone filled with her mana, feeding the treat to her delighted pet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is for your good behavior earlier, well done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The purring was as adorable as ever. Sadly, she didn’t have long to enjoy it as she saw that two unexpected figures began to approach their group. What were Leonore and Brunhilde thinking to suddenly approach them like that? Propriety demanded that they greet her first as she was part of a ducal branch family, even if they were in antagonistic political factions, but to her surprise Leonore, in fact did </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> offer any form of greeting as she spoke up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my, Lady Rozemyne, are you struggling with subjugating such a small feybeast? I would be happy to offer my assistance as your senior.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dear me, does my sweet Hisui look like she needs to be subjugated? Fear not, she is here with the approval of the archducal family. As a member of a branch family, I would most certainly not bring my pet here without permission. I do appreciate your kind gesture, however, Lady… Leonore, was it? I don’t believe we met before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah indeed, forgive me, you joined us so late today, it slipped my mind. May we offer you a first time greeting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could practically feel their displeasure as they exchanged glances. It took them longer than was appropriate before they kneeled and gave the seasonal greeting. A quick glance around the room informed her that any conversation had stopped and they were now at the center of attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of Life?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was kind of amusing to see this pathetic blessing being given to her, both of them stood up and continued their antagonistic questioning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you say this feybeast was your pet, Lady Rozemyne?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, her name is Hisui, and she is quite docile as long as me and my people are not threatened. You may pet her if you would like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leonore’s noble smile twitched slightly at her offer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How very kind of you, however, I will respectfully decline. I do not see the appeal in keeping wild feybeasts as pets except for shumils of course. Don’t you agree, Lady Brunhilde?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Lady Leonore, keeping a zantze as a pet is not trendy at all, Lady Rozemyne. You should consider a shumil, like other ladies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was still so strange for her to see this side of her dear retainers. Keeping up the passive aggression in their conversation was harder than she had expected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I’m not sure if my dear Hisui would get on well with a shumil, and due to some matters hidden under Verbergen’s shroud she will be accompanying me quite often from now on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is quite a shame.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, such a shame. Please do keep her close to yourself, if you must have her in the playroom, and away from more </span>
  <em>
    <span>sophisticated</span>
  </em>
  <span> ladies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could feel the tension between them rising at Leonore’s subtle slight. Even Brunhilde glanced at her for a second before looking back at Rozemyne to watch her reaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I shall do what I can, but unfortunately as you can see, Hisui has quite high standards.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation did not go exactly as she imagined her reunion with these two members of her old retinue would go, but at least it served a purpose. As all the children were subtly watching the conversation unfold, they now all knew the information she wanted them all to have: Hisui will be with her from now on, with permission. Most of the onlookers turned to their friends to whisper about the implications once Leonore and Brunhilde walked away from her in a huff, so only a few eyes caught Hisui quietly hissing after them once they were out of earshot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nevertheless, now that she had an excuse to keep Hisui by her side at all times, and the other children in the playroom knew to expect her there, there was just one more matter to settle… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The invitation for a meeting with Lady Veronica came the following day, she was invited to meet in three days time as usual, on the day when she had no lessons with Wilfried. She was prepared in one of her finer dresses that Tuulianne and Gretia dressed her in with ease, and took the carriage to the castle. After greetings were exchanged, Lady Veronica gestured for her to take a seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for graciously agreeing to meet with me, Lady Veronica. Your generosity knows no bounds.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, I am intrigued to hear how my grandson is progressing under your tutelage. That is what you wished to speak about, is it not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lady Veronica looked at her with her usual magnanimous smile, with no hint of annoyance in her voice, but her words had enough implications. Rozemyne planned for this meeting carefully, yet it already started with an oversight – in her attempt not to let Oswald know the details of her meeting with Veronica, she did not provide much explanation about why she was requesting the meeting to Veronica herself either. With their current difference in status, that was quite unheard of. And yet, while she was not offered any tea, she was allowed to take a seat at Lady Veronica’s table, a clear indication of her favor. It was quite regular to expect subordinates to give their report standing or even still kneeling. And so, Rozemyne decided to continue with her plan for the conversation, but play even harder into the humble young girl role.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, I bring you melodies of Ordoschnelli as it is my duty, but I also wish to ask you to be Anhaltung once more, if it would please you. Of course, it is for the benefit of the ones who rule the heavens, as always.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my, I see Mestionora smiles upon you, how wise of you to come to me for advice. Let’s hear the tunes you bring to me first, and I shall consider blessing you with my wisdom once those matters are settled.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made sure not to let the victorious smile she felt on the inside show on her face, but she crossed her arms and bowed her head, hiding her expression, just to be safe. Of course, Veronica was as easy to play as she expected. As long as she played the role of an obedient pawn, and spun her story to sound like she was working for the benefit of the duchy, Veronica was easy to please.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you wish. I am pleased to report that Lord Wilfried has been progressing splendidly in the domain of Kunstzeal. I cannot claim that he has developed an appreciation for the Goddess’ blessings, however he practices diligently during our lessons, and Anwachs is rewarding his efforts. I believe he should show adequate skill by his debut.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Adequate, you say? My, that is not very high praise of my dear grandson’s skills. In fact, to say such a thing about the future archduke is quite insulting, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I deeply apologise, Lady Veronica, I did not mean any offense. I simply hold your ladyship in very high regard, and wish to give you as accurate a report as possible, even if doing so would make my own skills appear lacking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That seemed to please Veronica, as she was no longer giving Rozemyne a sharp look. Doing so much ass kissing was getting on Rozemyne’s nerves in the meanwhile, but she needed the woman in a good mood for her request. Plus, highlighting that she was telling the truth, unlike those useless retainers who caused this problem in the first place, should do her some good too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well, as long as you ensure that he passes his debut without issue. That is your task as his harspiel instructor, do not forget it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But of course, Lady Veronica.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She bowed her head slightly to acknowledge the reinforcement of her given duty. The slight smile on Veronica's lips told her that she was succeeding in her attempts to please the woman before her. After a short moment Veronica voiced another question at Rozemyne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What of his other progress? Are you bringing me any melodies on his other retainers?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my, to think you would value my opinion on the rest of his education, Lady Veronica… I am truly humbled. I am afraid I cannot comment on much, I have not observed any of his other lessons, however I have heard that he is now attending them properly. However, on the matter of his other retainers, I am sure you have heard that I have recently sparred with Lord Lamprecht after he disagreed with my position among the guard knights.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Veronica’s eyes widened ever so slightly, and she picked up the cup of tea that was served to her before the meeting began, and took a slow sip. For the untrained eye, this would be the noble equivalent of acknowledgement and encouragement to continue. But Rozemyne did not miss the ever so small signs of surprise. So Sylvester really meant his “I’m not here” comment seriously… It was a bit unusual that Veronica wouldn’t know about something like this happening, but it was true that currently everyone else in Wilfried’s retinue was scared to report to Veronica, and neither Karstedt nor Elvira had any reason to talk to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had no tea of her own to sip to indicate wanting a reply – it was not a tea party after all, just a meeting to report – so she continued with her explanation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have of course settled this disagreement, as no knight has the right to question your or Aub Ehrenfest’s decision, and he has behaved accordingly since. However, Lord Wilfried’s other knights… This is related to the matter I wished for Anhaltung’s grace for, may I explain?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it related to Wilfried’s guard knights? Very well, let us hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne did her best to appear as humble as possible, she had to play the role of the inexperienced little girl seeking advice to perfection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you ever so much, Lady Veronica. If I may, allow me to explain from the beginning. You see, some rather troubling events occurred recently. There is an apprentice knight currently in the Academy, who wished to serve as my guard. I of course told her that it was not possible, but she prepared a namestone, and strongly insisted that I accept it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This suspicious reaction was precisely why it was imperative to set a good mood before she even began playing her charade. Of course Veronica would be alarmed by the sheer mentioning of name stones, seeing as she was the most prominent abuser of this practice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father told me I should accept it, that as a knight I should honor my fellow knight’s wishes, so I did, but truth be told, I am rather troubled by it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tilted her head and adopted the image of a lady in distress. Her refinement of the expression she stole from Angelica came into play.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never wished to hold any names, but I also could not bring myself to disregard my father’s advice and say no… ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Veronica’s expression changed into the one she had used in their previous meeting. Her grandmotherly facade came to the surface as she looked at Rozemyne with that fake warmness in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You poor dear, being pressured into that position. Indeed, it is a big responsibility, holding someone’s name. A young sprout such as yourself should not have to shoulder such responsibility.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew you would understand, Lady Veronica, you are blessed by Mestionora indeed. I had of course attempted to persuade the knight to dedicate herself to you or Lord Wilfried, rather than my unworthy self, but she could not be moved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne wondered if anyone could overlook the obvious twinkle of greed in Veronica’s eyes. At least she seemed pleased with her lie about suggesting to Angelica that she should choose a different master.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My my, you are already thinking about my grandson, I see you are embracing your possible future role of Flutrane or Schutzaria.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You humble me, Lady Veronica. It is only my duty to consider Lord Wilfried’s needs, I deserve no praise for it. But… I know knights should be working for the benefit of the duchy, and her serving me would not serve the duchy at all… She is not very smart, but she is a capable knight, and not utilising her for the archducal family would be a great shame indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Getting a good read of Veronica was harder than she had expected, her sudden mood swings were hard to work around. She appeared now pensive to her earlier words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is this relating to my dear grandson’s retinue, Rozemyne?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah yes, apologies for my long explanation. You see, Lady Veronica, I have broached the topic of training under me once I take up my position as Lord Wilfried’s Leidenschaft to my fellow knights, however they were not exactly… keen. They see training under someone as young as I as an insult which is understandable, but I fear that behaving like they do due to such trivial reasons is not good for Lord Wilfried’s protection. As my father tells me, nothing is more dangerous to a lord than a fractured retinue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My my, those are quite troubling melodies indeed. Your father is correct – a Lord surrounded by people he can not use due to their personal feelings is a terrible sight to see. Hearing that my grandson’s knights would be such people is quite the issue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Veronica’s noble facade faltered at that, her displeasure clearly visible on her face. Rozemyne almost felt bad for the lecture that the other knights would receive after this meeting. Almost. It was their own incompetence they were being blamed for, and as long as Rozemyne got what she came here for she couldn’t care less.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, very troubling, Lady Veronica. Especially considering that I regularly train and spar with my new knight who not only has no issues keeping up with my training regimen, but also has no complaints about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This knight of yours sounds like a useful asset indeed. Perhaps she could help motivate my Wilfried’s knight to train with you as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, are you suggesting she could join me in guarding Lord Wilfried and train my fellow knights with me? My, what a splendid idea, just as one would expect from you, Lady Veronica! Seeing that my family already pays her wages, she should need no further payment for these services, and she is bound to listen to my every comment by name! You are truly blessed by both Mestionora and Seheweit, Lady Veronica.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe she should have led Veronica to this idea a little more, but she was unlikely to suggest such an unorthodox solution herself anyways. As long as she attributed the idea to her, Veronica should see the merit in it. She was practically feeding her the solution of how to obtain more loyal knights for the archducal family for free, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are a bright child to pick up on </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> idea so quickly, Rozemyne. Indeed, that is exactly what I was suggesting. Of course, being a lady not in my grandson’s retinue does mean that she will not be allowed to enter his chambers or the east wing, but it will be valuable experience for her to guard the future aub after his baptism. You have my permission to utilise your namesworn for this purpose. And should you manage to convince her to offer her name to a more worthy recipient, I shall graciously take this burden from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are truly too generous, Lady Veronica. I thank you ever so much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rozemyne did not even have to fake her relief by much. She had expected much more resistance to her appeal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will be looking forward to more of Wilfried’s knights reaching your level of excellence from training with you after his baptism.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In other words, better make sure your training is effective, or else…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will strive to meet your expectations, Lady Veronica. You have been a truly invaluable Anhaltung, I am grateful that Dregarnuhr allowed our threads to cross today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, she has spun quite smoothly. Let me bestow one more blessing of Anhaltung upon you before I dismiss you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will graciously accept any advice you are willing to give me, Lady Veronica.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Veronica looked at her slightly stern now, that Rozemyne could not detect any apparent anger or other negative emotion was another confirmation of her success.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Accepting a name is a heavy burden indeed. I shall support you to carry the burden of this one name you have already accepted, however I fear the weight of too many names may become quite crushing for such small shoulders.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was not hard to recognize her parting statement as the subtle threat it was. She had to act more carefully from now on, but at least Rozemyne had achieved her goals in making Angelica switch into her own employ as smoothly as possible. Even granting her more opportunities to guard her, she was sure she would be delighted to hear it. So after giving one last bow to Veronica she left the room.</span>

    <p>Lieseleta looked out through the window of her room. The blizzard reminiscent of the time the Lord of Winter appeared was in full swing, she could only see a short distance outside. Lady Rozemyne had told them about the headache-inducing “order” of the archduke’s son. Why was Lord Wilfried interested in the adorable little zantze anyway?</p><p>Walking away from the window, she made her way towards her lady’s chamber. It was a pleasant surprise to meet Gretia on the way. The grey haired girl was really shy at first, but now that they had been working together for some time she seemingly began to leave her shell a little. The conversation between them was pleasant, short as it was until they reached their destination. Lieseleta opened the door and both of them entered Lady Rozemye’s chamber. As expected, Tuuliane was already awake and in the process of preparing a bath for their lady. Looking around, Lieseleta spied Delia was there as well, currently busy preparing new undergarments and placing them near the bathtub for their own convenience when dressing Lady Rozemyne. For a former gray robe, the slightly younger girl was truly helpful, and to Lieseleta’s shame still the best of them to prepare their lady’s hair.</p><p>Lieseleta was tempted to clench her fist in challenge, but refrained. She <em> would </em> hone her own skills to surpass the red-haired girl eventually! She was distracted from her own thoughts when Mathilde approached her.</p><p>“It is nearly time to wake milady. Could you help me with choosing a dress for her, Lieseleta? Also, Gretia, please prepare the oil we need for the massage later.”</p><p>“Right away, Mother.”</p><p>“Of course, Mathilde.”</p><p>Preparations went swimmingly and once they finished, it was Mathilde who approached Lady Rozemyne in her luxurious bed. From her place, Lieseleta was silently swooning when their lady got out of bed with the most adorable sleepy expression! It was not that often, sure, but a quick look inside the bedding revealed the cause, as a thick book lay most prominent on the mattress. It seemed Lady Rozemyne had read until late into the Dark God’s reign <em> again. </em></p><p>“Milady, I know we talked about letting you keep a book by your bedside, but you <em> must </em> go to sleep on time! Receiving Schlaftraums’s blessing is important to retain your abundant blessings from Efflorelume!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne simply huffed at Mathilde’s scolding. Seeing her lady grumpy like this in the morning only made her even more adorable in Lieseleta’s mind. She nearly lost her noble mask when Hisui jumped into the arms of her mistress and both of them began to openly cuddle! It was just so cute!!!</p><p>It was to her great regret she had to take the cute feline to the side. Being her main caretaker at least gave herself the opportunity to pet the tame zantze to her own not-that-secret delight. Even if she had to ignore the knowing looks from the others, she did not care. There was no shame in petting a cute little pet!</p><p>When the bathing was finished – all of them ignored Gretia and Delia’s normal gushing about their lady’s divinity – they escorted Lady Rozemyne to have breakfast with her parents. The unavoidable debate about bringing Hisui to the castle was expected, and Lieseleta could only agree to Lady Rozemyne’s words even if Lady Roselinde brought up a good point. There was just nothing to be done about it if she received an order from Aub Ehrenfest’s son.</p><p>After many assurances that Hisui would be on her best behaviour and not hurt anyone, they were finally allowed to go. When a servant opened the door for them as they were leaving, Lieseleta spotted an Ordonnanz flying past them landing on Lord Guthfried’s arm.</p><p>“Guthfried, this is Bonifatius! It’s here, come to the barracks!”</p><p>Lord Bonifatius’ loud voice echoed through the mansion, all the way to the carriage they were boarding as the message repeated itself. It seemed the Lord of Winter had finally shown itself, and the Knight’s Order would begin its subjugation. </p><p>The ride to the castle was uneventful as ever, but at least she was treated to the sight of Lady Rozemyne spoiling Hisui on her lap inside the carriage.</p><p>They arrived at the castle after traversing the still ongoing snow storm. Lady Rozemyne promptly turned around and gave her orders.</p><p>“I will not join you in the playroom, but will make my way directly to Lord Wilfried’s chambers. You may enjoy your time in the playroom without me today, short as it may be. I will see you all later when it is time to return.”</p><p>After confirming that everyone had understood her words, she left with Hisui sitting on her right shoulder.</p><p>When they entered the playroom, there was a wave of hushed whispers. When they split, Lieseleta tried to listen to everything she could. She found that most of the other children were speculating about where Lady Rozemyne could be. There were already many rumours going around due to her lady being absent for one bell every weekday. Rumours such as Lady Rozemyne going out to train in the blizzard, her being taken away by Lord Bonifatius for sparring, and even some about her already having been scouted to be one of the archducal childrens’ knights! Sadly, that last one was very close to the truth, but everyone believed that it was for Lord Sylvester’s pre-baptismal daughter. As they should. Who in their right mind would truly believe that their lady was forced to serve a boy? Even if he was Aub Ehrenfest’s son? Lieseleta recognized it for the slight and insult it was, a poor attempt to sully their Lady’s reputation even further.</p><p>She had to suppress a scowl at the thought. But before she could get lost in her dark thoughts, none other than Lady Rozemyne herself entered the playroom, with Hisui still on her shoulder! She seemed content to ignore the looks of everyone around her upon her entry. Lieseleta was the first to arrive and could not help herself but question her lady in a hushed voice.</p><p>“Milady, did you not say that you will not join us in the playroom today? You even bought Hisui with you, may I inquire what your intentions are now?”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne gave her reply in the same quiet voice to prevent the children around them from eavesdropping, but apparently not concerned enough to use a magic tool, so it probably wasn’t a secret.</p><p>“Lord Wilfried was quite taken by my Hisui. He <em> ordered </em> for her continued presence during his lessons. Avoiding the playroom entirely seems impractical, so I simply brought her with me.”</p><p>It seemed that Lord Wilfried was even more unreasonable than he was rumored to be. At this point Lieseleta suspected that those rumors among the Leisegang faction about the state of “the heir” were not unfounded at all. </p><p>All of them were surprised when they saw that two unexpected figures began to approach their group. What were Lady Leonore and Lady Brunhilde thinking to suddenly approach them like that? It was highly unusual as they preferred to not interact with anyone normally. Propriety demanded that they greet Lady Rozemyne first as she was part of a branch family, even if they were in antagonistic political factions. But to Lieseleta’s slight shock, Lady Leonore did in fact <em> not </em> offer any form of greeting as she addressed their lady directly!</p><p>“Oh my, Lady Rozemyne, are you struggling with subjugating such a small feybeast? I would be happy to offer my assistance as your senior.”</p><p>“Dear me, does my sweet Hisui look like she needs to be subjugated? Fear not, she is here with the approval of the archducal family. As a member of a branch family, I would most certainly not bring my pet here without permission. I do appreciate your kind gesture, however, Lady… Leonore, was it? I don’t believe we have met before.”</p><p>“Ah indeed, forgive me, you joined us so late today it slipped my mind. May we offer you a first time greeting?”</p><p>Their displeasure at being reminded about their blunder was obvious as both ladies exchanged glances. It took them longer than was truly appropriate before they knelt and gave the seasonal greeting as they should have at the beginning.</p><p>It was insulting to witness this <em> pathetic </em> blessing being given to their lady, even more so when both of them stood up and continued their antagonistic questioning. </p><p>“Did you say this feybeast was your pet, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Indeed, her name is Hisui, and she is quite docile as long as me and my people are not threatened. You may pet her if you would like.”</p><p>Lieseleta had to suppress a grin when Lady Leonore’s noble smile twitched slightly at the offer. She simply did not know what she missed out on.</p><p>“How very kind of you, however, I will respectfully decline. I do not see the appeal in keeping wild feybeasts as pets except for shumils of course. Don’t you agree, Lady Brunhilde?”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Leonore, keeping a zantze as a pet is not trendy at all, Lady Rozemyne. You should consider a shumil, like other ladies.”</p><p>Lieselta was torn about the thought of Lady Rozemyne having a shumil for a pet. On one hand, it would surely be the cutest sight she could imagine. But on the other hand, she was unsure if she could endure the sight without fainting by cuteness overload.</p><p>“Ah, I’m not sure if my dear Hisui would get on well with a shumil, and due to some matters hidden under Verbergen’s shroud she will be accompanying me quite often from now on.”</p><p>“That is quite a shame.”</p><p>It really was such a shame! She was sure Schlaftraum’s blessings tonight would feature her lady and lots of shumils. She nearly sighed, what a dreamy fantasy…</p><p>“Indeed, such a shame. Please do keep her close to yourself, if you must have her in the playroom, and away from more <em> sophisticated </em> ladies.”</p><p>She was brutally taken out of her beautiful thoughts and nearly bristled at the sheer gall of Lady Leonore! How dare she insult Lady Rozemyne like that?!</p><p>She could feel the tension between them rising at the subtle slight. Even Lady Brunhilde glanced at her companion for a second in confusion before looking back at Lady Rozemyne.</p><p>“I shall do what I can, but unfortunately as you can see, Hisui has quite high standards.”</p><p>After that dismissal both ladies walked away in a huff, the rest of the playroom was a heap of whispering until it was finally time for them to leave, what a day…</p><p>The weather cleared up just a few days later. The end of the continuous storms heralded the subjugation of the Lord of Winter by the Knight’s Order, and it took not long until Lord Guthfried returned to the mansion with his rightful spoils. Lieseleta noticed the absence of any invitation to the usual dinner together for Lady Rozemyne, but her lady didn’t seem to pay it any mind.</p><p>“It is only Natural for Ewigeliebe to seek companionship with Geduldh after battling in the Fires of Leidenschaft and Angriff. The Goddess of Wisdom can bide her time and seek comfort in the treasures of her domain instead.”</p><p>Her lady was truly more mature than she appeared, even if she used Lord Guthfried’s… lingering attention on Lady Roselinde to read more books. Lieseleta could not suppress a small smile forming on her lips at the sneaky maneuver. </p><p>Mathilde was not so impressed at their lady’s wisdom, and scolded her furiously for the mention of Ewigeliebe in such a vulgar manner. If Lady Roselinde got word of this behaviour, their lady most certainly would have been banned from Mestionora’s treasury as punishment. Lucky for her, Lady Roselinde was… occupied… that day.</p><p>The next day, it was Lieseleta’s turn to serve their lady together with Mathilde and Tuuliane at the now returned usual family dinner. After finishing their meal, Lord Guthfried surprised them all with a sudden exclamation.</p><p>“Rozemyne, I have a present for you. Please accept it with my most heartfelt wishes!”</p><p>“My, a present you say, Father? Of course, I will gratefully accept anything my beloved Father will gift me.”</p><p>Lieseleta wondered if this conversation should have maybe been held inside of a hidden room. Lord Guthfried’s loss of composure at hearing Lady Rozemyne’s reply was a break of propriety she sadly was not used to yet. She averted her eyes.</p><p>“My dear Dark God, please restrain yourself at least a little. This is not a hidden room…”</p><p>Lady Roselinde was quick as usual to reprimand her husband at least. Even if it was obvious that she was fighting a lost battle.</p><p>“Ah, my apologies. Just hearing my adorable Daughter saying those words to me was overwhelming. But enough of that!”</p><p>Lieseleta shifted her focus back to Lord Guthfried and watched as he indicated one of his own attendants to bring the gift. After just a few short moments he presented an ornate wooden box to Mathilde for inspection. If the small smile playing on the elderly attendant's lips was any indication, she approved of the gift at least. Mathilde then moved beside their lady to show her the item she was given.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne blinked upon looking inside the box, before her face lost its usual noble facade and a true smile bloomed on her face! It was even more breathtaking than before, as the younger girl’s eyes seemed to sparkle in childish delight! This was it! This was what Lieseleta had sworn to herself to protect at all cost. A beautiful and happy expression on her lady’s face! She nearly swooned, but barely held on to her composure. She was curious what present could evoke this reaction from her usually so composed lady…</p><p>She watched as Lady Rozemyne took her present out of the box, holding in her hands a book? Of course her lady would be that happy about a new book...</p><p>“I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the new book, Father!”</p><p>“That is not all, Rozemyne! The book will guide and instruct you how to create your very own manablade! I thought it better to give you the opportunity to choose whatever you want your weapon to look like. I know that you enjoyed your early brewing together with your mother, so you can use whatever you need from my personal ingredient storage.”</p><p>Lord Guthfried looked especially proud before continuing his explanation.</p><p>“I harvested the ingredients from this year's Lord of Winter myself. Only the best is good enough for my adorable daughter after all!”</p><p>“To give me access to your share of Schlageziel’s bounty… Truly, I can't thank you enough, Father. But does that not mean the ingredients are dyed in your mana? How does that affect the brewing itself? Would it not make the weapon more powerful to harvest the ingredients myself?”</p><p>Lieseleta’s eyes widened slightly, did she hear that right? They were talking about her lady brewing? Already? By herself?! And just how advanced was her lady in her studies to ask those questions already? Wait, did that mean Angelica’s own manablade was hindering her slightly because it was not perfectly matched to her?</p><p>“Nothing to worry about, Rozemyne. I have been told that you only need to overwrite my mana in the ingredients, our colors should be similar enough for that. So when you dye them, it will work as if you harvested the ingredients yourself. Anyway, the book will tell you more about the whole process, but essentially you just need to dye the required materials and create the base of the manablade of your choice. You are already more proficient in brewing than I was during my academy years, so it should be no trouble for you!"</p><p>Lieseleta’s head was spinning. What were they even talking about? Lady Rozemyne was more advanced than her own father in her knowledge of brewing? She was just seven! And this conversation did not relieve her earlier worry about her own sister's manablade. Lord Guthfried nearly glowed in happiness though.</p><p>“I hope you like my gift?”</p><p>“I love it! Thank you so much, Father!”</p><p>“Ahh. My daughter is so adorable!”</p><p>Lieseleta could not really fault Lord Guthfried for his undignified reaction. Lady Roselinde seemed to agree as she did not chastise her husband this time. Her lady’s true smile was just too bright, this conversation should have really happened inside of a hidden room! At least this way Lieseleta could bask in her lady’s warm expression too, but her spiraling thoughts evened out her own happiness somewhat.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne practically devoured the contents of her new book in the following days. The obsession was starting to get out of hand as she re-read the book at least three times! At least she promised to add it to the library after the brewing was complete…</p><p>Curiously, Lieseleta was allowed to witness the creation process of her lady’s new weapon. The speed of the dyeing process was slightly startling. How was Lady Rozemyne able to completely overwhelm Lord Guthfried’s mana in the ingredients like that? Was it maybe because their colors were so similar? She had so many questions now.</p><p>Following the instructions in the book, Lady Rozemyne first sorted the ingredients based on the elements required for each step of the process. While she didn’t need to purify the mana in each ingredient, knowing which elements were the strongest in each of them were important – apparently, these were supposed to be added close together. Next was the preparation of ingredients. Lieseleta didn’t quite know which pieces were what parts of the Lord of Winter, but Lady Rozemyne identified them with ease, and chopped some of them into tiny pieces with expert motions using a knife. Some things also had some sort of skin that needed to be peeled off, but according to Lady Rozemyne, Lord Guthfried already did most of the cleaning of the ingredients when he collected them. He really did a very thorough job.</p><p>After finishing her explanation, Lady Rozemyne began to draw two startlingly complex looking magic circles onto pieces of parchment without any error!? The mana pen was handed over to Mathilde – who took the assistant role in the whole process – before adding the first set of ingredients to the pot. After she mixed the stones and feybeast pieces in the pot for a while, the pot suddenly filled with liquid as they all melted! At precisely that same time, she threw in the first piece of parchment Mathilde handed to her. To Lieseleta’s shock, the parchment itself dissolved immediately, however the magic circle shined just above the surface of the liquid while it sloshed around, being mixed. It was a fascinating process.</p><p>“Time for the next phase.”</p><p>This was the sign from Lady Rozemyne to hand her the next batch of ingredients she prepared. And just as they’ve done so, the magic circle flashed and disappeared, and the liquid also thickened and reduced to a much smaller amount. The next part of the process was quite similar. Adding ingredients, mixing until they melted, adding the second magic circle which shone with blue light this time, until it disappeared and the liquid became even thicker. Finally, at this stage, Lady Rozemyne continued mixing while the thick liquid started to form into something solid. She even shut her eyes tight at one point. Lieseleta’s confusion must have shown on her face as Mathilde informed her that Lady Rozemyne was concentrating hard on the mental image of the hilt she was creating. A bright light suddenly filled the room, and by the time she was able to look at the brewing pot through the dimming glow, a manablade hilt with a stone in brilliant Leidenschaft blue set just below the strange ledge-like feature between the hilt and the blade sat where the liquid was previously.</p><p>They were told that Angelica’s blade took half a bell to create, brewed by an experienced medscholar, but it took their lady only the time to brew tea twice before she had her own manablade. The difference between med- and archnobles was truly greater than she could have imagined. For her mana weapon, Lady Rozemyne chose a most peculiar form of a… sword? At least the handle indicated it as such, however it did not look like any sword handle she had seen before. Not like she’d seen many up close except for her sister’s.</p><p>The swords she had seen before had round handles, often made of two distinct cylinders, with the feystone at one end, and a thin bar across on the other. This one, on the other hand, was square the whole way, it seemed to be just one piece of material from one end to the other. There was no feystone set at the end farthest from the blade, instead it sat right where those two parts met. There was also no big bar across between the handle and the blade, instead it was a small plate, barely bigger than Lady Rozemyne’s hand around the hilt. The most peculiar part was the inscription, however. Some lines ran from the top to the bottom in intersecting patterns, as if they were part of some incomplete magic circle. They also changed colour to a soft blue as Lady Rozemyne started to fill the blade with her mana.</p><p>The blade itself grew before Lieseleta’s own eyes in just a few short moments! That was so much faster than Angelica’s painstakingly process!? Strangely, it curved slightly, but who was she to criticize her lady’s preference for her own weapon. She was slightly confused by Mathilde’s expression though. She was staring at Lady Rozemyne in obvious shock before she seemingly remembered something sour and looked at the ground with an angry expression on her face. By the Seven, she even clenched her fists in anger! What was Lieseleta missing here?</p><p>“Hmm, that looks even better than I imagined.”</p><p>Lieseleta was happy that she at least understood what her lady was doing as she swung the formed mana blade around. It reminded her of her older sister’s actions when she mumbled about the balance of her new treasure. As Lady Rozemyne continued to swing the blade to test it, her movements started to change. Instead of simple stabs and slices, she started forming arches with the blade, her mannerism softening. She no longer had her other arm dropped by her side, instead moved it elegantly with the motions. After a couple steps in this manner, she changed to holding the strange sword with two hands, and continued drawing shapes in the air with the sword as she began to move with more force. However, she stopped quite suddenly, in the middle of the next motion, with a look on her face that Lieseleta found difficult to read. Pensive, maybe?</p><p>“Tuuliane, could you fetch Jenni for me?”</p><p>“At once, Milady!”</p><p>Lieseleta watched in slight confusion as the younger laynoble speed walked out of the room. For what would Lady Rozemyne need the former gray robe? </p><p>At least she didn’t have to wait long until her curiosity was sated, as it took mere moments before Tuuliane returned with Jenni in tow. Said fanatic wasted no time and kneeled before their lady with her usual peaceful expression on her face. Did Lady Rozemyne even know that this woman surpassed even Delia and Gretia in their fanaticism about her supposed divinity?</p><p>“You called for me, my Lady? Whatever use do you have for me?”</p><p>“Ah, Jenni, I require your expertise. See this blade? It is my new manablade I just created. I do think it is as if Vulcanift himself lent me his aid in its creation, and I want to integrate it in my developing fighting style, however I feel I am missing something. Knowing your blessing by Kunstzeal, I would appreciate your opinion on the matter. I want my dance to not only please Angriff, but Kunstzeal as well.”</p><p>The pleased twinkle in the young woman's eyes was hard to miss as she stood up.</p><p>“I live to serve you, my Lady. You honor me by asking my opinion, I will do my best to meet your expectations.”</p><p>Lady Rozemye simply nodded before walking into the middle of the room again, her new blade at her side. As the young archnoble closed her eyes and took on a stance similar to Angelica when she practiced for her blade dance, Lieseleta finally understood.</p><p>“There is no music, so maybe it would be best for myself to give a foundation.”</p><p>Lieseleta’s eyes widened slightly, Lady Rozemyne wanted to sing too? She was not prepared for this! But her worries were unfounded as their lady just began to hum a melody instead of singing. The humming itself was beautiful to listen to, yet for some strange reason it caused Lieseleta’s hair on her back to rise. But that was easily ignored in favor of watching the “sword dance” Lady Rozemyne was currently performing.</p><p>“So beautiful...”</p><p>Angelica’s practice could simply not compare.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s elegant twirling movements were reminiscent of what she heard about whirling. Her long midnight-blue colored hair appeared to be sparkling as she just spun and spun. The blade in her hand did not stop for a moment as it flowed through the air in the most impressive showcase of grace Lieseleta had ever witnessed. The showcase of her lady’s skill was nearly as spellbinding as her singing. If not for the cold feeling of the melody she could have watched on for hours. Sadly, their lady seemed unsatisfied and ended her practise with one last twirl before looking at Jenni expectantly.</p><p>“What do you think, Jenni? Would Kunstzeal be pleased?”</p><p>“She would be absolutely delighted, my Lady. Soon your dancing will begin to rival your divine voice! Hm, but maybe you should move around a little bit more? It seems-”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s ability to ignore the zealous rambling around her was truly enviable. Lieseleta could only hope to gain the same immunity soon. Even if Jenni may have a point at least in this regard. And there was no denying her apparent expertise in dancing. Her advice elevated the blade dance to even greater heights.</p><p>At least the rest of the season passed by without any mind shattering revelations or incidents. That was until her older sister returned from the Royal Academy. At least she remembered to give a greeting to their lady this time before getting lost in her own excitement.</p><p>“Milady, I have returned. And I bring pleasing melodies too! I managed to succeed in every one of my courses in the Royal Academy. I do not even need to take remedial classes this year! Please, praise me for my efforts!?”</p><p>Lieseleta’s eyes widened as she could not help but stare at her older sister in justified shock. Angelica had passed without needing supplementary classes? She was willing to learn and succeed just to get a few simple words of praise and mana for her blade? Well, Lieseleta could understand the desire to be praised by their lady at least, but seeing the results of her lady’s ploy to get Angelica to learn were scary to witness!</p><p>“My, my, so you did. What a pleasing melody from Ordoschnelli to bring, Angelica. I <em> knew </em> you could succeed if you applied yourself. I do expect you to put in the effort to pass your classes from now on when I teach you. But still, you did <em> very well. </em>” </p><p>Lieseleta did not know how to feel about the fact that her older sister’s true smile emerged at the praise Lady Rozemyne heaped upon her, nor the fact that she obviously enjoyed the fact that their lady began to pet her head again so much that she closed her eyes in apparent bliss!</p><p>…Were those headpats really that good?</p><p>“You were such a good girl. And good girls get rewarded, so of course I will give my mana for your blade. Just as I promised you, Angelica.”</p><p>“Thank you so much, Milady!”</p><p>Lieseleta had to avert her eyes, it was just too much. It was too cute, and it did not involve any cute animals! She was just glad that Hisui decided to cuddle with her earlier, giving her the opportunity to subtly press the adorable feybeast more firmly into her chest at the sight. The pleased purring was only a bonus!</p><p>“I recently created my own mana blade, so I had enough practice filling it with my own mana. Tell me when you want to receive your reward, and I will make time for you, Angelica.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne’s words caused Lieseleta to focus her attention back to the blue haired girls currently locked in conversation.</p><p>“A… manablade. Created by yourself and filled with your own mana…”</p><p>Lieseleta noticed that her sister was now looking at said blade with a strange sense of… longing? But after just a moment she suddenly blinked and looked at Lady Rozemyne’s with an emotion similar to when she was gifted her own blade by their parents.</p><p>“I… Did- did you learn to create it just- just to learn how to fill my blade?”</p><p>“My wonderful Father generously gifted me with the means to be Vulcanift of my own blade myself. I do plan to use it as my main weapon from now on. However, is it not only a matter of course that I do my best to uphold Gebordnung to my retainers? Of course your rewards were part of my motivation to do so, Angelica. I promised you to give my mana to your blade.”</p><p>“I- f-for me? I-”</p><p>Her beloved older sister nearly broke out in tears at Lady Rozemyne’s touching words, but just shook her head a few times before bowing her head.</p><p>“I can’t thank you enough, Milady. I am undeserving of your kindness.”</p><p>“...No retainer of mine is undeserving of my kindness, <em> you belong to me</em>, afterall. So of course I will show you kindness and will reward you when you deserve it. Especially when you honor the Goddess of Wisdom for me! It is only natural.” </p><p>She could not help herself but smile at Lady Rozemyne’s words. Lieseleta truly chose her master well.</p><p>After all that emotional turmoil it was decided that Angelica would receive her reward in two days. Lady Rozemye’s schedule was simply not free enough beforehand. </p><p>On said day, Lieseleta had to watch in exasperation that her single-minded older sister was nearly shaking in excitement when she arrived at the mansion. Who thought it was a good idea for herself to greet and escort Angelica to their lady’s chambers, she would never know.</p><p>“Sister, please calm down a little. You should not present yourself like that to our lady…”</p><p>Her older sister looked at her as if she had said something truly strange. It ticked Lieseleta off slightly to receive such a reaction as she tried to help her beloved sister. Again.</p><p>“What are you talking about, Sister? How can I not be excited? Today I will finally receive my reward for all of my suffering! My lady will give some of her beautiful mana to my blade… I cannot wait. I wonder how it will feel to wield it afterwards!?”</p><p>“…What suffering are you even talking about? They were just lessons in the Royal Academy. And are you not already covered in <em> our </em>lady’s mana constantly? You did swear your name to her, how greedy can you get?”</p><p>How was it that her airheaded sister did not realize how she sounded to others, talking about Lady Rozemyne’s mana freely like that? The superior smirk blooming on her sister’s face annoyed Lieseleta to no end.</p><p>“You do not know what you are talking about, little Sister! The feeling of being wrapped in Lady Rozemyne’s mana is simply the best! How could <em> anyone </em> not desire to feel more of it? It is simply so warm and comforting as it wraps tightly around-”</p><p>“I do <em> not </em> want to hear this! Please keep your shameless descriptions to yourself!”</p><p>Lieseleta could only avert her face from her absolutely shameless sister. Surely it was doused in the color of Geduldh, considering how warm her cheeks felt. Thankfully Angelica decided to heed her plea and simply followed her the rest of the way silently. After ringing the bell and being allowed entry into Lady Rozemyne’s chambers by Delia, all of them silently entered the room before closing the door again.</p><p>The red-haired girl informed them that their lady apparently was still in the process of being dressed, which was fine. Angelica wordlessly took her usual place beside the door, allowing Lieseleta and Delia to go and help finish up the usual morning procedure. It was one of their lady’s rare free days, so there was no need to hurry after all. Everything happened just like usual until just slightly after third bell when Lady Rozemyne eventually spoke to Angelica.</p><p>“I think it is time for you to receive your reward now, Angelica. Could I ask you to hand me your manablade?”</p><p>“Yes! With pleasure, Milady!”</p><p>At least there was no reason to chastise her older sister as she was mindful enough to not pull out her blade as she approached. Lady Rozemyne simply took the weapon, in its still sheathed form and pulled the weapon out before beginning her inspection.</p><p>“Is there something specific that you desire, Angelica? Some aptitudes you are lacking, blade length or something else?”</p><p>“Ah, I would be overjoyed with whatever you seem appropriate, Milady. Eep!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne stopped her inspection of the blade to look sternly at Lieseleta’s sister with a dark look. Even Lieseleta could not help but straighten her own back as a sudden oppressive feeling fell over the room.</p><p>“That will <em> not </em>do. What aptitudes do you currently have, Angelica?”</p><p>“F- Fire and Wind, Milady!”</p><p>“Hm, how fitting for my blade and shield.”</p><p>Why her older sister was now blushing in the color of Geduldh was something Lieseleta would most likely never truly understand. But at least it seemed to make Angelica happy?</p><p>“I will make sure that you will receive the correlating protections, I will not allow you to fail in this regard. Now, clearly state to me what your own desires for your blade are.”</p><p>“Yes, Milady! I want my blade to have as many elements as I can. I began feeding it earth attribute feystones from defeated feybeasts just recently, but I have not seen any results so far.”</p><p>Lieseleta let out a sigh in relief when the oppressive feeling vanished. How does Lady Rozemyne even do that? She had to ask Mathilde later when she returned from her meeting with Lady Roselinde.</p><p>“Tell me your desires when I specifically ask for them in the future, Angelica. I cannot fulfill them if I do not know them.”</p><p>“Understood, I am sorry.”</p><p>Seemingly satisfied, Lady Rozemyne continued her inspection of the blade before placing her hand on the stone and closing her eyes. It took only a few moments before she opened her eyes again and sheathed the weapon before handing it back to Angelica.</p><p>“I imbued it with my mana, mostly focusing on the aspects that you are lacking. I filled it just slightly under the capacity I could feel within, but please make sure to give it some more of your own mana to ensure your ownership.”</p><p>“Yes! I cannot thank you enough, Milady. I cannot wait to see how it will feel to wield a blade filled with your beautiful mana! Oh, how wonderful! Maybe we could even have a spar? Please, Milady!”</p><p>Lieseleta could feel the beginnings of a migraine at her older sister's thoughtless words.</p><p>“How can you talk to your lady that way? Please mind your speech! I am so sorry about my master, master of my master. Please forgive her.”</p><p>Everyone stared in shock as her sister’s mana blade began to scold its wielder and apologized to Lady Rozemyne in Lieseleta’s own voice! Everyone looked at her now.</p><p>“I do not have anything to do with it!”</p><p>“But it's clearly your voice, Lieseleta…”</p><p>She glanced at Gretia for the comment before glaring at her own stupid sister.</p><p>“What did you do?”</p><p>“Nothing!”</p><p>The blade spoke up before anything else could be said. It was so weird hearing her own voice spoken without her doing so!</p><p>“I was born from Lady Rozemyne’s mana, the master of my master.”</p><p>Everyone’s looks shifted to Lady Rozemyne who seemed to be… annoyed?</p><p>“I was infusing the blade with my mana and <em> specifically </em> only wished it to be imbued with additional elements. Also, why do you speak in Lieseleta’s voice now?”</p><p>“Anhaltung works in mysterious ways. Also, it was my master’s sister’s mana inside me and the firm desire to protect and guide her sister which gave me her voice.”</p><p>Everyone looked at her again. Her cheeks felt so warm, and she just wanted to hide as her feelings were laid open before everyone to see. She blamed her sister for her lost composure.</p><p>“That was over a year ago! And I just gave it a little bit because Angelica practically begged me constantly for it! Also why should I not wish only the best for my older sister?!”</p><p>“You truly are the best little sister I could have ever asked for.”</p><p>Lieseleta just placed her hands over her face to hide her expression. Hearing the loving tone and seeing the true smile on her sister's face was just too much. Why did she feel the need to say it that openly? It was so embarrassing!?</p><p>“Anhaltung should only act <em> for </em> the Goddess of Light, not freely in her domain, she is but a pillar after all. And while <em> my </em>pillar may need her guidance, she shall pray for it when Gebordnung compels her to.”</p><p>Wait, did Lady Rozemyne just imply that the Goddess herself was responsible?! And why was she looking at the blade with growing anger now? That was not good at all!</p><p>“My master is favored not only by Leidenschaft, Angriff and Schutzaria, but Gebordnung as well. It is only right that Anhaltung places her protection to support her fellow subordinate. The Goddess of Light wishes to support the servants of the cho-”</p><p>
  <em> “Silence!” </em>
</p><p>Lieseleta nearly buckled under the sudden weight of Lady Rozemyne’s mana. Her fears just became reality as she could feel their lady’s anger clearly in her voice.</p><p>“Their care is an Ewigeliebe out of season. Ice has no place in summer, the kin of Leidenschaft belong only in his domain. Duldsetzen's blessings are only so powerful, Nyx's creation nearly summoned Verfuhremeer already. Any more, and I fear neither Goddess could calm the fire that would be unleashed.”</p><p>“I am simply the messenger, master of my master.”</p><p>It hurt! She could not help but gasp for air as it felt as if the world was attempting to Crush her! Apparently their lady did <em> not </em> like this answer. Lieseleta could no longer remain upright, dark edges appeared in her vision as she felt herself falling to her knees. This was even worse than the first time!</p><p>“Milady, you are Crushing the others.”</p><p>She promised herself to hug her beloved sister later, as the crushing feeling vanished as sudden as it appeared. It took Lieseleta a few more moments to get her bearings before even attempting to stand up. She risked a look around. Apparently everyone was still crumbled on the floor except Angelica and Lady Rozemyne. Her older sister had simply kneeled but showed no signs of appearing troubled at all. How?!</p><p>“If the Supreme Couple wishes to know of me, then you can be their Ordoschnelli, and remind them of the threads Dregarnuhr intersected. Tell them they will be greeting that little spawn of Ewigeliebe in a different manner if the weave repe-”</p><p>“I am sad to say I am unable to do that. I was given the message before I was created, but there is no further connection, master of my master. My apologies for my failure to assist you.”</p><p>Lieseleta shakingly got back on her feet. Her legs felt still a little bit shaky, but the open scowl on Lady Rozemyne’s face held more of her attention. She barely suppressed her shaking at seeing the scary sight.</p><p>“…Fine. If you speak of it ever again, I will undo Vulcanift’s work myself, understand?”</p><p>“Perfectly, master of my master.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne looked up at Angelica next, taking her namestone into her hands!</p><p>“You will not question your manablade about the contents of our conversation without my explicit permission.”</p><p>“Never, my Lady!”</p><p>The silence stretched as Lady Rozemyne closed her eyes and seemed to try regaining her usual composure. It took her longer than expected before she gave up and began glancing around the room a few times.</p><p>“I am truly sorry for Crushing you all like this… We will never speak about this conversation again. I will retire to my hidden room, you may notify me if something of importance requires my attention.”</p><p>Lieseleta watched as their lady still struggled with suppressing her anger as she stood up, just what had enraged her to this decree?</p><p>“Um, Milady, a question. If I may?”</p><p>
  <em> “...Yes?” </em>
</p><p>Lieseleta flinched at the sheer coldness in Lady Rozemyne’s voice. It was the first time that she looked at her older sister in slight awe as she faced the angered archnoble without any trace of fear at all! She paused, was this what it meant to be an unshakable pillar? It seemed her older sister stood far above her in this regard. What an unusual fact. She clenched her fist.</p><p>“May I be permitted to name my mana blade Ledelys?”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne's anger seemed to abate slightly as she looked at Angelica with a strangely blank face instead.</p><p>“You want to name your blade Ledelys?”</p><p>“Only if you permit me to, Milady.”</p><p>“…You may do so.”</p><p>With those parting words, their lady simply turned and wordlessly entered her hidden room. Aside from the repeated proof of their lady’s richness in mana, just what had shaken her so much that she got consumed by anger to this degree? She clenched her fist even harder, she would strive to make Lady Rozemyne’s life even more comfortable! She may not be able to soothe whatever had hurt her in the past for now, but she will do her utmost to become a first rate attendant so Lady Rozemyne could smile her true smile as often as possible!</p><p>She eyed Delia – who was still kneeling on the floor, staring at the entrance to their lady’s hidden room with unconcealed reverence – in determination. The first step was to become better than the former gray robe. Not an easy task, but Lieseleta would not allow herself to fail. She would become a sturdy pillar for Lady Rozemyne. Just like her older sister!</p>

    <p>Wilfried wanted to pout. After his beloved grandmother had visited him, everyone around him seemed… tense? He did not know how to describe it, but they were acting a little bit weird. Also, they suddenly wanted him to study things, which was just not fun at all! Why would they even try to tell him what to do? Did they forget he was the future Aub?</p><p>Another strange occurrence was when his favourite knight, Lamprecht, got invited to go home for lunch with one of those orda-things? He did not seem happy at all. Strange. Wilfried always loved to eat with his father or grandmother, maybe the food at Lamprecht’s home wasn’t as good as in the castle? That would make sense, they were only archnobles after all. So he reassured himself that it was nothing he had to worry about, and let the matter drop.</p><p>At least there was the fact that his grandmother made a surprise visit, which made him quite happy. Seeing her loving smile as she petted his head was the highlight of his day.</p><p>“Grandma, I’m so happy to see you!”</p><p>“I am delighted as well, my dear Wilfried. I hope everything has been alright since our last meeting?”</p><p>He pouted at the question. Surely if he told his beloved grandmother, she could help fix the strange behaviour of his retainers?</p><p>“My retainers have been so rude! They are trying to tell me that I need to finish my lessons now. I mean, I did finish them, just like you asked me to, but still, they shouldn’t be telling me what to do! And the lessons are not even fun!”</p><p>His grandmother chuckled before guiding him to take a seat at a nearby table. After both of them were comfortable, she began to explain.</p><p>“My dear Wilfried, I told you those lessons were necessary. You will become the Archduke in the future, so you must show your superiority to those below you. There is sadly no avoiding the simple fact that there are still some people left who think it wise to hinder our rule.”</p><p>“But why not simply punish them for it?”</p><p>It was so confusing, why did they not simply punish those mean Leisegang he was constantly warned about?</p><p>“They are quite crafty in their ways, my sweet. Even the Archduke cannot punish them if they do not make an obvious mistake, it would set a bad example. The Archducal family is the paragon for every noble in our duchy, therefore we must show them how to act and always show our superiority by standing above their petty behavior. Do not worry, I will help you to learn to recognize their malice and show you how to deal with it after you have had your baptism.”</p><p>He simply nodded at the explanation. He did not fully understand it yet, but he was aware that he was superior to them by being the next Archduke.</p><p>“But let us not sour our mood by talking about those fiends. I am so proud that you are not running from your lessons anymore. You truly have done an exceptional job tackling them, my little knight.”</p><p>He puffed his chest out in pride at the praise. The lessons were annoying, but his grandmother was of course right. He was doing an amazing job.</p><p>“Speaking of those lessons. I am saddened to tell you that your previous harspiel instructor informed me that he could no longer teach you because of personal reasons. It was quite a struggle, but I managed to acquire a replacement who will teach you until your debut at least.”</p><p>Wilfried did not really care who tried to teach him, he did not really see the appeal in playing harspiel anyway. Music was stupid, and harspiel was the most boring instrument. He still nodded his head to show he understood, earning him another head pat! </p><p>“I know those lessons are boring, my dear, but they are necessary. Can I depend on you?”</p><p>He happily gave his assent, and they did not speak of any other boring topics. He simply told Grandmother about his recent adventures, much to her apparent delight.</p><p>A few days later, he was busy with another of those damn lessons when Oswald suddenly requested to be excused. He wanted to fetch someone? He gave his assent and watched his attendant leave before turning to his favourite knight.</p><p>“What did Oswald mean? Do I get another retainer?”</p><p>“Indeed, my lord. Rozemyne should have arrived at the castle now, so it falls unto Oswald, your head attendant, to greet and escort her to your chambers. May I remind you that your grandmother spoke to you earlier about finding a new teacher?”</p><p>Oh, he remembered now. His beloved grandmother did tell him she got a new teacher for him. But he was a bit confused about the name, so he questioned his knight.</p><p>“Right! I remember now, thank you Lamprecht. Rozemyne… that sounds like a girl’s name. All of my retainers are guys, so why now a girl?”</p><p>“Do not worry my lord. It may be… special circumstances, but she comes highly recommended, I have been told.”</p><p>He simply nodded before returning his attention back to his current lesson – learning the alphabet. It was sooooo boring. He just wanted to leave, but he promised to finish them. Ugh. </p><p>“My lord, I have brought with me your new retainer. She is currently awaiting the honor of your presence in the entry room.”   </p><p>That was fast! He used the opportunity that Oswald’s return presented to make his escape.</p><p>“She is here already? Let’s go, Lamprecht!”</p><p>He used the opportunity to run around a little as he spied a figure kneeling in the center of the greeting room. Running up to her, he was about to address her when she suddenly spoke up first.</p><p>“I am honored beyond words that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate together today, Lord Wilfried. I am called Rozemyne. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe, the God of Life?”</p><p>Her soft voice sounded really pleasant. Wait, this was their first meeting. As her superior, it was expected from him to grant her request to greet him. He got this!</p><p>“Oh, sure!”</p><p>“O Ewigeliebe, God of Life, may this meeting be blessed.”</p><p>After giving her blessing she stood up, and he finally got his first good look at her appearance. To his surprise, she was pretty young – probably not much older than himself. The first thing he noticed was her sparkly, golden eyes that looked back at him with an emotion he could not place at all. Although, to be fair, he never really tried reading emotions. Everyone was always just in awe of him anyways.</p><p>She was super pretty too! Her really pretty face was framed by her dark-blue hair that reminded him of the sky outside at night. It was all shimmery too, a bit like Grandmother’s hair, but even nicer. It looked like it would be soft like the shiny fabric Grandmother’s clothes were made from. He wanted to touch it. But before he could reach out his hand, she stood up. She looked even prettier standing up, she moved so softly and she just stood with her hands clasped in front of her. </p><p>“Woah, you're really pretty.”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced to his right briefly before looking at him again, a pleasant looking smile now on her lips.</p><p>“Oh my, you flatter me with your words, Lord Wilfried. Being praised for their abundant blessings of Efflorelume is most pleasing for any lady to hear. But fear not, I am not unfamiliar with the art of Grammaratur, you need not abandon Verbergen’s shroud for my sake. It is best to avoid any misunderstandings, after all. Seeing as I am to become Erwachlehren in addition to Leidenschaft in your service, it would only attract off-tune Ordoschnelli to fly.”</p><p>“Um… what?”</p><p>He understood nothing of what she said! Well, he was understanding the words, but they just made no sense put together like she did. His confusion must have shown on his face as she glanced to both of his sides. He heard Oswald speak up suddenly.</p><p>“Um, maybe you should forgo the dance of Grammaratur for now, Rozemyne?”</p><p>Whatever they were talking about seemed to upset the pretty girl standing before him greatly, as her voice lacked any of her previous warmth. Maybe Oswald said something rude to her… He furrowed his eyebrows, he did not want Oswald to upset her.</p><p>“You mean to say our lord was not instructed in the abundant dancing of Grammaratur, a crucial skill of all noblemen? Was it not your own duty as Erwachlehren to bring Mestionora’s grace, to guide him in his spring days, that he may enter his first steps into summer unburdened?”</p><p>“I- Ahem, that may be going a bit far, but… Yes.”</p><p>She stared at Oswald for a little bit more before she smiled at him again. So she really was just upset with Oswald. He should tell him off later.</p><p>“I see, very well. Do excuse me, Lord Wilfried, I will refrain from burdening you with Grammaratur’s dance for now. Please allow me to become Erwachlehren– ah, a teacher for a moment instead.”</p><p>“Burden, what burden are you speaking of?”</p><p>Seriously, what were they talking about? And everyone beside him seemed capable of understanding her? What was he missing?</p><p>“Do not mind that for now, my lord. Are you allowing me to become Erwachlehren?”</p><p>He had no clue what the Erwach-thing was at all, but her smile was so reassuring he simply accepted her request.</p><p>“Um, alright?”</p><p>“Thank you. I beg your forgiveness, but I will try to speak more plainly for now. It seems to me that you did not understand much of what I previously said, is that correct?”</p><p>He looked to the side, feeling slightly ashamed to be the only one not understanding her.</p><p>“No, not really.”</p><p>“Do not fret, Lord Wilfried. It is the missteps of your attendants, not yourself. They merely failed in their duty to become your teachers. It would be expected of you to understand what I just said. To not do so would be dangerous for you in social circles in the near future, and as the one chosen to protect you it would reflect badly on myself, and everyone else that serves you. So it needs to be corrected as soon as possible.”</p><p>Was that why his lessons were so important now? Was that part of what his grandmother told him about? But that just meant more lessons. He could only grimace at the thought.</p><p>“But I am the future Aub. Why would I need to worry about what people say? They should know their place.”</p><p>“…It seems your teachings are more flawed than I expected, let me give you an example. Do you know about the Royal Academy, Lord Wilfried?”</p><p>Finally she said something he knew about!</p><p>“Yes! I was told about it. It is the place you will go to when you reach the age of ten to learn cool stuff like becoming a knight, and a true noble.”</p><p>“Exactly, it is a place for learning and becoming a true noble, but this is not true only for our duchy Ehrenfest. Noble children attend from every Duchy of Yurgenschmidt. Of course, as the future archduke your power will be of great influence inside Ehrenfest, but you have to think about your standing in the whole country too.”</p><p>He was following her words with rapt attention, her voice was just so pleasant to listen to.</p><p>“Ehrenfest is not ranked highly in the current hierarchy, we are placed in the middle of the current ranking to be exact. Think about them in the terms of laynobles, mednobles, archnobles and archdukes. Our ranking would mean even as the future Aub you would merely be a mednoble in terms of authority between the other archduke candidates in the Royal Academy.”</p><p>What? He would be that low among other Archduke candidates in the Royal Academy? Why did no one inform him of this earlier?!</p><p>“You will not face much trouble here in Ehrenfest, but at the Academy you would be judged by those above your station, so it is important that you arm yourself with the knowledge and skill to beat, or at the very least evade any opponents you may encounter in your stay there.”</p><p>That explanation made sense to him. It was similar to what his grandmother told him previously.</p><p>“I see, so you are saying if I am not told about how to understand what is said to me, I will not even know I am being attacked, and can be beaten at the Academy?” </p><p>The smile he received made her look even more pretty than before!</p><p>“Exactly, Lord Wilfried. That is precisely what I meant to tell you, but we got slightly off track in our conversation. Do you want to know what I said in the beginning of our meeting now?”</p><p>“Yes, please!”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded before beginning her explanation.</p><p>“After you praised my appearance, I tried to make it known that I appreciate the compliment, but as I am your retainer, you must try to hide your compliments towards me, or any lady for that matter. They could be used to hurt your reputation, as showing your favor towards any girl that openly could be interpreted very badly by others.”</p><p>He nodded absentmindedly. Was this one of the ways his enemies would try to hurt him? His grandmother warned him about it but did not go into details just yet. He needed to know more to better prepare himself for any attack. He was Grandmother’s little knight, after all!</p><p>“I see."</p><p>“I also made a reference to my role inside of your entourage. It was decided by Aub Ehrenfest himself that I will become your teacher in learning to play the harspiel and the necessary skills in singing.”</p><p>The memory of his music lessons came back to him. Endless repetition of trying to hold the strings that hurt his fingers, and needing to remember where to press down to make the sound right, but failing. Boring, simple songs that sounded even worse on his probably faulty harspiel… He did not like those lessons. At all.</p><p>“But I do not like to play it…”</p><p>“Forgive me for being blunt with you, but what your desires are on the matter are irrelevant. It was your father, the Aub, who decreed so. So you will learn to play it, and I will do my best to teach you.”</p><p>Damn it, if his father was the one ordering it he could not refuse. Not unless he complained to Grandmother and she took care of it.</p><p>“In addition, it was decreed by our Aub that I will replace Lord Lamprecht as your new head knight. But that can wait until you finish your debut. I will do my best to learn from him anything that is required to fulfill my assigned duties.”</p><p>That completely took him by surprise. She would replace Lamprecht? That was just not happening! She was just a little bit older than himself, and Lamprecht was his favorite knight!</p><p>“You will replace Lamprecht? But I like him. And you are a girl! You could not possibly be better than him. I will not allow it!”</p><p>“Again your opinion on the matter is irrelevant, Lord Wilfried. It was the decision of our Aub. Please remember that your words could be taken as rebellious, or even treasonous. So please refrain from uttering anything similar in the future.”</p><p>Rebellious? Treasonous? Did he really sound like that? He didn’t even know he<em> could </em> commit treason, was that not just about other nobles acting out against him?</p><p>“T- treason? But I-”</p><p>Rozemyne interrupted him before he was even given the chance to explain himself.</p><p>“Yes, treason, so please just accept his orders and do not question Aub Ehrenfest’s orders openly ever again, Lord Wilfried. If you have complaints about his decision, bring it up with Lady Veronica or your father in a more private setting, but not before your retainers, or anyone else for that matter. It could have grave consequences for everyone involved.</p><p>That was right, Grandmother would not allow it!</p><p>“I will speak with Grandmother then!”</p><p>He did not like how she simply nodded at him, seemingly uncaring about his retort.</p><p>“Indeed that is the best course of action, Lord Wilfried. But if I may voice my humble opinion. I do not believe it will change anything.”</p><p>Her confidence made him feel unsure. He looked at Oswald for further reassurance, but he just nodded his head in agreement before explaining his perspective.</p><p>“My dear niece is correct, my Lord. It was decreed by Aub Ehrenfest just before we arrived, and Lady Veronica was the one who recommended Rozemyne in the first place. Please trust in your grandmother’s decisions, she only wants what is best for you.”</p><p>So Rozemyne was Oswald’s niece? Was that why she was so unafraid to voice her opinion?</p><p>“So she is your niece, Oswald?”</p><p>“Indeed, young Rozemyne is the daughter of my sister, Roselinde. Our family is most proud of her and her recent accomplishments. But I believe this is enough for now, my Lord. I still need to give my niece the information she requires to be able to serve you better. May I suggest you talk with her more after she has had the time to study them?”</p><p>Wilfried in turn just nodded and looked at Rozemyne again. He had so much to think about now.</p><p>“I have much to think about, thank you for your honest words, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She bowed her head at him in return.</p><p>“Do not worry about thanking me, Lord Wilfried. It is my duty to advise and serve you from now on.”</p><p>As he retook his seat at the table, he looked at his recent attempts at learning the alphabet. He had to be better, or he would be exploited by his foes. He just had to… endure… the boredom, surely it would end soon enough.</p><p>The next day marked the start of the harspiel and singing lessons with Rozemyne. Despite all the conversation about needing to learn it no matter how much he doesn’t want to, he was still not very willing to study until the pretty girl made a surprising offer.</p><p>“Maybe it would be more motivating to experience the joys of Kunstzeal’s gift firsthand. May I offer to give a demonstration, my Lord?”</p><p>He looked up from that damn instrument in his hands, already prepared to accept the offer if it meant he could stop practicing for a bit. The distraction was very welcome, if surprising.</p><p>“You mean you want to show me how to play? My last teacher did that too, I do not understand what is so good about playing harspiel…”</p><p>Rozemyne simply held her soft smile as she answered.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord. That is part of what I am offering. I meant to show you how the full experience would look. May I show you how the song you need to learn will sound, singing and instrumental parts included?”</p><p>That was new. But he was no knight in training for nothing as he immediately saw the opportunity and struck!</p><p>“So I can just listen to you for my lesson and don’t need to play that thing myself? Sure, show me!”</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>Rozemyne moved a little, seemingly to get more comfortable in her seat. It took not long until the first notes of music began to fill the air and she started to sing.</p><p>He got lost in Rozemyne’s voice as she sang the song he had struggled with so much, with utter perfection. It was like being in a trance, before being gently guided back to reality as the performance ended. He could not help but look at her in complete awe at the difference between their performance. She was still sitting in the chair with harspiel in hand as the final notes rang out, and she was still just barely smiling, with her eyes closed. It was like she was feeling the music. It was so, so…</p><p>“So beautiful…”</p><p>The words slipped out of his mouth before he could stop them. At least his outburst only came out in a mumble. He shook his head before addressing Rozemyne with enthusiasm, who was just looking at him now. Was she waiting for his opinion?</p><p>“Your singing is really pretty! I see what you mean now, it is so different from what my previous teachers did.”</p><p>“Oh my, Lord Wilfried, did we not already cover that you need not abandon Verbergen’s shroud for my sake. Your praise of my blessings of Kunstzeal are not that much different from your previous comments, praising my blessings of Efflorelume.”</p><p>Her answer was a little bit annoying. She <em> was </em> just so pretty and her singing was simply beautiful, why was he reprimanded for voicing his praise to her?</p><p>“…But you <em> are </em> really pretty, and a good singer too. Why can I not praise you for it?”</p><p>Her smile did not dim at all as she answered his question. </p><p>“… My Lord, do forgive me for my directness. What you just told me could be taken as a confession, or the showcase of your desire to court me with the intention of marriage. Please consider your choice of words more carefully. It would not do for the heir of the archduke to speak those words to his own lowly retainer, or any other girl, if you do not wish to convey those exact intentions. That is why we use the names of the gods.”</p><p>He did not like how she was speaking about herself. It wasn’t like he met many girls before, sure, but he was certain she would still be a pretty one compared to others. And Grandmother said that he gets only the best retainers, didn’t she? So why could he not praise her talent and looks when it was true? Was he just using the wrong words?</p><p>“…So it is acceptable if I say you are heavily blessed by Kunstzeal and Efflorelume instead? And you are not lowly…”</p><p>Rozemyne simply smiled at him, but when she started to shake her head, he knew he had done something wrong again.</p><p>“No, it is not, Lord Wilfried. You may praise my blessings of Kunstzeal, seeing as I am your teacher in the arts. But under no circumstance should you make any comments about the fact you find me blessed by Efflorelume. It would imply you find me attractive, which could still be taken as a confession. In some cases, it could even imply an insult, despite your intentions to compliment. It is best to avoid until such nuances are clear to you.”</p><p>“But I- Urgh…”  </p><p>He didn’t know what a confession really was, but he <em> did </em>find her attractive! That’s why he kept telling her she was pretty! Was that not obvious? Plus, he wanted to spend more time with her, looking at her while she sang for him again. It was the most beautiful thing he ever witnessed!</p><p>“May I suggest we focus back on your lessons, my Lord? I know you are not this interested in Kunstzeal’s domain, but once you have mastered the beginning of this melody, I could offer to give another demonstration if you like it so much?”</p><p>Wait. She would?!</p><p>“Really?! You would? Ok, show me how to hold my fingers on the harspiel again, please!”</p><p>Maybe these lessons wouldn’t be so bad after all…</p><p>Their daily lessons fell into a pattern after that. Rozemyne would arrive for the lesson, help him set up his harspiel and instruct him to do some scales, then they would start practicing a section of the song he needed to learn for his debut. If he did a good job or he was getting really stuck and losing motivation, she sang for him, and he could just sit and listen. He was not really willing to admit to anyone, but he started having fun in the lessons, and he especially liked it when he could listen to his pretty teacher’s singing. But nothing particularly interesting happened in the lessons until a couple days later.</p><p>He just heard that Rozemyne had appeared for his usual lesson. He had waited the whole morning for it, so he charged into the room heading straight towards her, only slowing his approach after seeing her blank look in his direction. Did he do something wrong? Oh, right, he was supposed to allow her to approach him and offer her greetings first. He stopped before her and just waited. She bowed to him before speaking.</p><p>“I am honored that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together once again under Ewigeliebe's harsh judgement, Lord Wilfried. May I inquire if you are ready for your lessons?”</p><p>“Yes. Let’s start right away!”</p><p>She just gestured for them to take their seats. The lesson itself was pretty uneventful, but apparently he did well enough that she decided to sing the song for him again. It was as delightful to listen to as ever. The end of the lesson came just too quick in his opinion. She handed her instrument back to a nearby attendant and prepared to leave.</p><p>“This will be all for today, my Lord. You did much better than last time. At this rate you will have no trouble at your debut if you keep working hard.”</p><p>He ignored the praise – as welcome as it was – he just was so curious about her and never had any opportunity for them just to talk a little.</p><p>“Wait a moment, please. Um, say, you are really blessed by Kunstzeal and Grammaratur, Rozemyne. Do you practice often too?”</p><p>“I do indeed, my Lord. Most of the blessings of the Gods require constant practice to not fall out of their favor. I practice the arts at least two times a week. More, if my schedule allows for it.”</p><p>He smiled – his plan was working so far, this was easier than he had expected.</p><p>“Do you take lessons in anything else? Like, have you learned to read yet? Or do you take lessons in training? You will take Lamprecht’s place after my debut, right? So you are good at fighting, right?!”</p><p>He noticed that her left eyebrow twitched a little upon hearing his questions. Maybe. Was that a good or a bad sign? She was just so hard to read!</p><p>“Oh my, Lord Wilfried, Verbergen shrouds a Lady for a reason. I am sure you recall when we discussed that a Lady does not outright answer a question unless she benefits from it, so you should dance with Grammaratur more gently to allow her to reply indirectly. Of course, matters relating to the domain of Leidenschaft are easier discussed with knights in your employ, but you should still take care while I am only your Erwachlehren. You would not wish to be thought of as Elbberg pining after Verfuhremeer.”</p><p>He frowned before looking at the ground. He had trouble understanding her when she spoke like that. He truly did try his best in those lessons about “Grammaratur’s dance” as they called it, but it was just so hard. Could she not just speak plainly with him all the time like the others?</p><p>“But I talk with my other retainers openly all the time.”</p><p>“Then I am most regretful to bring you such bitter melodies, but it seems they still continue to fail in their duty to be your Anhaltung on these matters. Also, there is the difference of our gender. You are a Lord, meanwhile I am a Lady. There is simply a difference in how to talk and approach each other that you need to be aware of and follow, lest you make any mistakes. Verbergen can only conceal potential missteps while you are hidden from prying eyes in the castle. After your debut, he won’t be able to stop errant Ordoschnelli from flying.”</p><p>He understood that! He knew she was just trying to warn him about potential rumors, but he did not care about them at all. She would serve as his head knight after his debut, so it was only normal that he would speak with her often! Right?</p><p>“But will I then not have you at my side at that point? You will become my knight, not just my teacher like right now!”</p><p>“As I said, it will be somewhat easier to speak of the matters in Leidenschaft’s domain – that is, matters related to me serving as your knight. But a knight is not supposed to openly guide, or even worse, teach their master in simple matters like that. That is what your attendants, scholars and teachers are for, my Lord.”</p><p>Rozemyne raised an eyebrow as he looked at her in complete shock. She thought the way she spoke was <em> simple? </em> It was still so hard for him to understand her sometimes!</p><p>“S- Simple? You call how you can speak <em> simple?” </em></p><p>“It is indeed a simple matter, Lord Wilfried. I am currently refraining from using some of the more esoteric phrases in the dance of Grammaratur. I deeply apologize if that was insulting to you in any way. Shall I speak less openly from now on?”</p><p>“NO! I mean, no, it is fine how you speak right now.”</p><p>Please no! He truly tried his hardest to learn those phrases. He just wanted to better understand her, be closer to her. He had to try even harder then!</p><p>“Very well. As I said, it is not my place to teach you this, Lord Wilfried. I will simply guard you from harm, or slay your enemies at your command. I am neither your scholar nor attendant, and I teach you only music until your debut. To do any more would not only overstep my place, but it would mark your other teachers as incompetent in the eyes of noble society and stain your reputation.”</p><p>He slumped slightly at her explanation. Was it really that bad that he wanted to become closer to her?</p><p>“However… Why don’t you try to ask me your question again, in a less direct manner, and I shall consider answering.”</p><p>She gave him a chance! If he remembered correctly, she called herself his Erwachlehren and Leidenschaft at their first meeting, and Erwachlehren meant teacher… right? So Leidenschaft meant becoming a head knight? But was he not also the main god of knightly matters? Ugh, so confusing! </p><p>“Erm… Since you will be my head knight after my debut, uhm, why don’t you tell me about your experience in… Leidenschaft’s domain?”</p><p>“My, if I didn’t know better, I might think you were mocking me, suggesting that I don’t have any experience, with so much hesitation.”</p><p>He forgot that! Damnit! He did not want to convey that at all. He wasted his chance to properly speak with her now…</p><p>“But I am sure such nuance will come with practice. I do have plenty of experience in Leidenschaft’s domain, my Lord. I train regularly and think of myself as adequate in combat. There is still much for me to learn until I can equal my Master, but I look forward to it. Aside from lessons, I also spend some time with my pet, Hisui, that Schlageziel blessed me with. She is quite smart and adorable.”</p><p>He was just happy that she still told him a little bit about herself despite his failure. Wait, she had a pet?</p><p>“Oh, you have a pet? Can I see it?”</p><p>“If that is your desire, I can bring her with me tomorrow? She is not shy, but I must warn you that she is still a zantze. They can be quite ferocious if not handled correctly.”</p><p>What was a zantze? He knew about shumils, his dad said he had one before, but he wouldn’t call those “ferocious” according to the descriptions. </p><p>“But you said she is smart, so she obeys you, correct?”</p><p>She nodded at him.</p><p>“She does. There was no trouble so far and she obeys any order I give her.”</p><p>“Okay, then bring her tomorrow!”</p><p>Rozemyne looked around them, but he was more occupied with reading her expression than being concerned with those around them. Which was still impossible, but he would not give up!</p><p>“As you wish, Lord Wilfried. I will bring Hisui with me tomorrow. Be sure to look forward to your harspiel lesson – I am sure you will not let the presence of my pet detract from your hard work in Kunstzeals’ domain. However, it seems Dregarnuhr spun our thread with exceptional speed today. May I be excused? I still need to return to the playroom after all.”</p><p>It seemed that it truly meant it was time to end their pleasant conversation. How regrettable, but he still allowed her to go. He would see her tomorrow after all. </p><p>He was <em> so </em> glad he made the request as soon as he saw Rozemyne with the furry thing when he entered the room the next day.</p><p>He just barely held himself back to allow Rozemyne to give her greetings, but he did not waste a moment more than necessary, looking at the small creature with excitement.</p><p>“So this is your pet?” </p><p>“Indeed, my Lord. This is my pet zantze, Hisui. I offer my deepest apologies if my language today may be more crude than normally. I did not have the opportunity to train her to understand more sophisticated commands yet. I need to be fairly direct when giving her any commands or speaking to her in general.”</p><p>He waved his hands, there was no need for her to apologize. He actually preferred it when she spoke plainly to him.</p><p>“That’s okay. I do not mind it in the slightest. So she even knows commands? That’s so cool! Show me!”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded before placing her pet at the ground. The small Feybeast turned to look at her as if awaiting a command. It was so cool!</p><p>“Hisui, this is Lord Wilfried, the one I am guarding. Be a good girl and be nice to him from now on. Now, do three spins and sit.”</p><p>The smart beast obeyed her without hesitation, sitting at attention after doing the spins as instructed. It was awesome!</p><p>“That's <em> so </em> cool! And does she obey any command you give her? Can I pet her?”</p><p>“She does. You may pet her to your heart's content.”</p><p>He lowered himself a little to gently pet the super cool feybeast on the head. He was a bit hesitant at first, but after seeing that his gestures were receiving a positive response, he could only smile. He felt his confidence returning with every caress. She had quite the soft fur, it was pleasant to touch in his opinion. On closer inspection, her fur had nearly the same color as Rozemyne’s hair. He paused. Would her hair feel similarly pleasant to touch?</p><p>“As you can see, my little Hisui is quite the darling. Still, I need to ask if you desire to play a little bit more with her, or would you prefer that we start your usual harspiel lessons now?”</p><p>Now that was a hard question to answer. Does he play with the cool pet or have his lesson with Rozemyne first? Ah, who was he kidding, he would prefer spending time with Rozemyne over nearly anything else. </p><p>“It would be best to do the lesson first.”</p><p>“As you wish, Lord Wilfried. Hisui.”</p><p>Her pet got out from under his hands, jumping into Rozemyne’s arms before climbing on her shoulder! His initial disappointment vanished upon seeing the cool sight. </p><p>“Should we then move to our usual seating arrangement?”</p><p>He didn’t get as much praise as he would have liked during the lesson, but at least he could see Hisui’s ears moving to the sounds of his harspiel as she sat on Rozemyne’s shoulder. It did make it a bit difficult to hit the notes though. Once the lesson was finally over, he eagerly waited to see if Rozemyne would offer to sing or have a conversation with him again, but she just said that they would continue at the next lesson, and he can go play with her pet now. He was a bit disappointed, playing with the cool feybeast was the most fun he had in a long time. Maybe he should ask Grandmother for a pet too… On the other hand, Grandmother would probably want him to have a shumil or something boring like his dad had. He knew just the thing to do!</p><p>“That was even more fun than usual. Can you bring her regularly from now on?”</p><p>Rozemyne did not answer immediately before Oswald rudely interjected their conversation.</p><p>“That would unnecessarily burden Rozemyne, my Lord. Not to mention that your progress suffered slightly from your split attention. May I suggest refraining from that avenue?”</p><p>“But when she is always here, it will become normal, right? I just had so much fun with her. I want to see her more often!”</p><p>He dismissed Oswald’s advice before turning to Rozemyne.</p><p>“So, bring Hisui here for those lessons from now on!”</p><p>Rozemyne kneeled before him with her arms crossed and head slightly bowed.</p><p>“I will do as you command, Lord Wilfried.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>The following weeks were uneventful, but at least he had fun with Rozemyne and her pet. The busy mood for his baptism was a bit annoying though. He just beared with it until it was finally time and he made his way to meet his father. He could not help but feel excited, finally he would not be restricted to the east wing anymore and could freely explore the castle! </p><p>Arriving at the waiting room, he was warmly greeted by his grandmother. Oddly, his father was whispering with another woman a few paces ahead, but as his grandmother was already talking to him, he didn’t pay them any attention at all.</p><p>“My dear Wilfried, it is good to see you. I hope you are feeling well? On this big occasion it is normal to feel nervous after all…”</p><p>The obvious care shown to him by his beloved grandmother warmed his heart.</p><p>“I am happy to see you too, Grandmother! I am just excited honestly.”</p><p>She simply chuckled before gently guiding him towards his father and the woman he now recognised as his mother he’d seen at dinners on occasion. The woman was as quiet as usual. They never really spoke before, all he knew about her was that she was his father’s wife. His father, however, was obviously as excited as himself, if his big grin was any indication.</p><p>“Wilfried, there you are! I hope you are excited for your first big event?”</p><p>“I am! Thank you, Father. I cannot wait!”</p><p>His father placed his hand on Wilfried’s shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>“Just remember to look straight ahead. No looking around. Just follow our lead and follow the priest’s instructions to stamp your medal. After receiving your ring and giving your first blessing, it's done. It’s easy, trust me.”</p><p>“I know, Father. I was told what to do multiple times!”</p><p>Wilfried threw a curious glance to the woman standing to the side, but everyone seemed fine to not talk about her. He didn’t really know what a “wife” was, but she was clearly not as important as Grandmother. He chose to follow their lead and dismissed her from his thoughts too. After just a few short moments his father and grandmother took the lead, and the doors to the hall were opened. He straightened his back and began to walk as they made their way towards the altar standing prominently at the back of the hall.</p><p>Looking around was tempting, as he could feel many eyes on him, but he resisted the urge. As their superior, he had to show them how it was done, after all. Arriving at their destination, he looked at the priest who would instruct him.</p><p>He wore white robes with golden accents, blue hair in a much lighter tone than he had seen before, and golden eyes. His face seemed devoid of any emotion as he began to guide Wilfried in the steps to register his medal. It was as easy as expected, and after stamping the medal there was a round of applause before his father approached and gifted him his ring, declaring him as his son and earning him another round of applause. He glanced to his right where grandmother stood wearing a proud look on her face. This truly was just as easy as he was told beforehand.</p><p>The actually boring part began right after though, as it was time for introductions. He had dreaded this part. Apparently it was custom that every noble worthy of his attention would introduce themselves to him. He had to suppress a sigh. At least his curiosity was finally sated as the woman introduced herself as Florencia, his father’s wife… So he was right!</p><p>Although, that didn’t tell him very much about her. He was of course aware that grandmother raised him because he was special. The next Archduke. And he vaguely remembered his father calling this woman – Florencia – his mother before, whatever that meant. But then why was she introduced to him differently this time? He was about to ask questions when his granduncle stepped forward and introduced himself. It was honestly kind of intimidating how he looked at him with that piercing stare. He could not explain why, but it made him uncomfortable, so he was glad when it was finally over. He had to try so hard not to smile when the next person stepped up.</p><p>Rozemyne was introduced as his new head knight, and she knelt in front of him to give her greeting. She was looking quite different to her daily look during their lessons together. She had a big poofy dress on like the other ladies, and she was dressed in mostly green instead of her usual blue. She still looked nice, but he preferred her everyday look.</p><p>“I am honored that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly once again, Lord Wilfried. Please allow me to reintroduce myself. I am called Rozemyne, and by the grace of those in the heavens, I will act as your Leidenschaft upon your debut. Rest assured I will do my utmost to protect you with my life. Would you allow me the honour of guarding you on this most jubilant occasion today?”</p><p>He felt kind of proud that he understood most of what she was saying. Those awful days of learning were finally starting to pay off!</p><p>“I look forward to your service as my knight, Rozemyne. Yes, you may do so.”</p><p>“You honor me, Lord Wilfried.”</p><p>He seemed to have answered correctly, as she smiled before bowing her head and taking her new place just behind him, where Lamprecht usually stood. It was a little bit weird, but not that bad.</p><p>Sadly, he got bored pretty fast as the introductions never seemed to end. And for some reason everyone seemed to glance at Rozemyne in confusion, which did nothing to improve his mood at all. </p><p>Maybe he should just make a run for it? The thought threatened to put a smile on his face. He prepared to bolt when he suddenly felt a hand on his right shoulder, clamping down on him in a firm grip. He tried to look at it only to realize it was hidden by his fancy clothes, just under the cape his attendants made him wear. He wasn't even aware that was possible! After the noble before him – some Giebe or whatever he said – finished introducing himself, he used the opportunity to glance behind him.</p><p>It was no one else but Rozemyne! Her pleasant smile practically screamed danger, sending a cold shiver down his back. But wait…</p><p>Maybe he could impress Rozemyne with his strength by breaking free? And so far he had always been able to escape his guards anyway. Then, she would have to chase after him, and they could even be alone together, and he could try to have a conversation with her again instead of listening to these boring introductions!</p><p>With his plan set, he tried to subtly move away, but to his growing distress, she was able to hold him seemingly without any effort! That hand was like steel, holding him in place without any chance of escape! </p><p>Even when he abandoned any form of subtlety it changed nothing. Just how strong was she to hold him in place like this?!</p><p>“Oh my dear Wilfried, could I speak with you for a moment?”</p><p>He halted in his struggle when his grandmother addressed him, looking at her he did not know how to respond.</p><p>“I- um.”</p><p>After a few more moments where he tried to regain his bearing, he was steered to his Grandmother's side, the ironclad hand never leaving his shoulder. Grandmother indicated for them to follow her as they stepped outside for a moment. When the door to the hall closed behind him and his grandmother looked at him with that disappointed look that made him feel so small…</p><p>Grandmother sent a glance behind him and the hand holding him in place vanished immediately.</p><p>“My dear Wilfried, I realise that greeting those below you is not the most thrilling experience, but it will not do for your discomfort to be so obvious that everyone can tell.”</p><p>“But why do I have to be uncomfortable for their sake? I’ve done the ceremony like you said, can I not just go and play now?”</p><p>His grandmother sighed at his reply before looking at him sternly. He could already tell that he would receive a lecture now. He was not looking forward to it.</p><p>“Wilfried, every noble in the duchy gets introduced to the adults that need to know about them after their baptism. Today is your first chance to make them understand that you are better than them. So we don’t want them thinking you can’t listen to these simple introductions, when they themselves could do so. You will sit through the rest of them quietly and regally to show everyone your status. You <em> can </em> do that, as the next Archduke, can’t you, my dear?”</p><p>“Yes, Grandmother. I am sorry.”</p><p>He looked at the ground, feeling slightly ashamed to have disappointed her.</p><p>“Use your knight for example. She knows how to follow directions without the need for them to be spelled out. Do you want to look worse than your own retainer, my little knight?”</p><p>He could not help but glance behind him where Rozemyne was currently standing a small distance away, her face even more unreadable than before. He did not like her looking like that, to be honest, but still turned around to reassure his grandmother regardless.</p><p>“No, Grandmother. I will do better now!”</p><p>“I knew I could count on you.”</p><p>Grandmother gave him a reassuring smile, which settled his nerves a bit, before gesturing to Rozemyne to step closer.</p><p>“Before we head back – Rozemyne, you have done well to support my grandson in his effort to stay present at his celebration.”</p><p>Wilfried wasn’t exactly sure what, but he felt like something changed about his grandmother’s expression when she looked at Rozemyne. It was an odd feeling, as she was still smiling, but it still felt kind of off. Maybe he was simply not used to how ladies talked among themselves.</p><p>“It is my duty, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>Rozemyne crossed her arms and bowed her head, and that seemed to be the right thing to do, as Grandmother sent them back to the hall.</p><p>They returned to the center of attention, where the rest of the boring introductions continued. At least he had to suffer through something like that only this one time. Right?</p>

    <p>He could not hold his tears as he fell to his knees. He did not even dare clinging onto hope to see his Lady like this ever again after she vanished in that blinding ray of Light. She looked so peaceful, it was easy for him to see her exasperation, tinged with a bit of confusion. Her beautiful golden eyes sparkling with hidden emotion as their shine lit up the room. How long was he bereft of this glorious image? Having to see the pale and lifeless imitation of them when she even deigned to show them to begin with? The only confusing part was that she looked so… young. Suddenly his head was assaulted by foreign memories, forcing him to close his eyes as the pain of a migraine hit him like Vulcanift’s hammer. Kneeling on the floor, he tried to focus on the sudden influx a little bit more, which seemed to alleviate the pain somewhat.</p><p>Memories of his life before his first year at the Royal Academy filled his brain, but there were some important changes he took notice of. For one, his divine Lady seemed to be part of the nobility a whole year sooner than last time, under her birth family as well? He nearly sighed in relief. That meant she would not be forced to slave away under their incompetent archducal family, at least for now. </p><p>He opened his eyes again to glance at the direction where her parents were currently waving their schtappes around, proud looks on their faces. Seeing Gunther and Effa… no. Lord Guthfried and Lady Roselinde that happy and as part of Ehrenfest nobility meant that the light he saw earlier was proof that the Gods themselves had interfered again.</p><p>He had to suppress the urge to grimace. Their earlier interference brought only pain and grief to his Lady, but he could not argue that it was welcome at this very moment. He could not suppress his awe. It was as if time had reversed itself! It seemed the Gods had decreed to reweave the fabric of time itself, surely because his Lady had set them straight about their many failings! A new weave…</p><p>As he absentmindedly got up, he couldn’t help but gaze at his divine Lady again, standing there in all of her youthful splendor, harspiel in hand. It seemed he was back at her debut? He blinked in confusion as he took in her appearance a little bit more closely.</p><p>She was taller than he expected, looking her current age – which he presumed was seven – already. Was it another blessing from the Gods? Did that mean she would not suffer constant fevers anymore?! He nearly jumped in joy at the thought! His Lady’s happiness was the most important thing in existence, surely being healthy would mean she could read to her heart’s content? </p><p>“I did not expect her singing to cause such a mess. Is she favored not only by Angriff and Efflorelume, but Kunstzeal herself as well?”</p><p>He nearly scowled at Cornelius’ silent mumbling. His Lady had felled so many more people with her singing than just a few fainting boys being misled by Bluanfah. As if anyone not chosen by herself was worthy! Seeing her dance in the battlefields of true Ditter as she slew untold amounts of their enemies was something one had to truly witness to see the true beauty of a real sword-dance. He just hoped she would not be forced to do it again… </p><p>But he was aware that was a faint hope, not truly worth considering. He would bet everything he owned that the Gods needed her to fix their shortcomings and bring order back in their unruly garden, one way or the other. Just like before.</p><p>Also… Efflorelume? Was Cornelius harboring a rafel for his own sister? Wait, she was not laundered to be part of the Linkberg clan. So it was quite normal, and truthfully expected he would be captured by her divine nature as well! Sadly, he seemed to be only hearing the whispers of Bluanfah, a true pity.</p><p>Unfortunately he was given little chance to speak or even see his Lady, as the chaos that followed ensured the swift end of the festivities. When he returned home after the debut ceremonies, he sought the sanctuary of his own hidden room – there was so much to plan for now.</p><p>His Lady was currently just an archnoble, so he could not serve under her officially for now. But that was easily solved. He just had to create a namestone and present it to her at the earliest opportunity!</p><p>He rejoiced as he realized that this time <em> he </em> would be the first to give her his name! A privilege robbed of him by Roderick in the last weave because of his own stupid hesitance.</p><p>He clenched his fist. He would use his first year at the Royal Academy to hire trustworthy knights to gather the required materials, then he would find an excuse to speak with his Lady and present her with his name! It was the perfect plan! Ah, he couldn’t wait to feel her mana engulfing him in its oppressive nature as she marked him as her loyal servant again.</p><p>Still, he noticed that his Lady seemed to do things much differently this time – further proof that she had her previous memories as well. There was no sight of any of her previous inventions, aside from rinsham. If she had no memories, she would surely have invented printing by now to acquire more books to read.</p><p>He would have to speak with her before making any plans, making sure to understand her current desires from the very beginning this time. Thinking about his disastrous failures as her retainer in the last weave made it a necessity to inquire about her designs and desires first before he took action.</p><p>He learned that the hard way when she nearly returned his namestone in her fury after she discovered his scheme to save her from Ehrenfest.</p><p>He shuddered at the mere memory.</p><p>It was only because they spoke plainly after she nearly cut him loose for his presumptions that he truly understood how much he had failed her as her head scholar. It was his greatest shame in her service. Regaining her trust took years, but he was just relieved to not meet a similar fate as Traugott. His Lady’s true anger was of the cruelest nature of them all. </p><p>Apathy.</p><p>Losing access to her endless compassion and blessings could cut deeper than the sharpest blade or the most evil scheme.</p><p>Like any good retainer, he learned his lesson, thanking every God or Goddess that he was given one last chance to regain her favor. This time he would inquire about her desires <em> first </em>.</p><p>But how to do it? As a firm member of the Leisegang faction, he could not approach his Lady, as she was a Veronican.</p><p>’…’</p><p>It felt so weird to think that, as if <em> anyone </em> was worthy to have his Lady among their ranks. They should be grateful to be part of his Lady’s faction instead!</p><p>Ultimately he did not find a solution that day. Being forced into doing essentially nothing was unsatisfying to an annoying degree, as he could only gaze occasionally at his Lady with concealed longing in the playroom until it was time to depart for his “first year” at the Royal Academy.</p><p>At least she seemed happy as she drew parts of her old retinue back into the light in her service. Even if it was curious as to why her sister by blood, Tuuli – or Tuuliane as she was named now – was just a lay-attendant in her service. He had to research the happenstance around that when he returned.</p><p>Still, seeing Lieseleta and Angelica follow her around already was at least assuring him that she was well protected in body and mind. Or at least he prayed so.</p><p>The only thing he was absolutely not prepared for was his childhood friend, Cornelius’, continuously growing rafel for his Lady. That would obviously create a gulf between him and Leonore, who was already looking bothered at the situation if the thinly veiled looks of jealousy were any indication. He just had no time for senseless talking about romance when he could instead improve himself and his information networks to better serve his divine Lady.</p><p>After his departure, he spent much of his time at the Royal Academy building said network – the coursework was laughable easy after all. Becoming an honor student was only natural for him.</p><p>Rebuilding and expanding his network was far easier this time as he already had rudimentary knowledge where and how to push. He even gained a new in by befriending an older scholar of Dunkelfelger. No doubt it would come in handy later for information regarding Lady Hannelore or Lord Lestilaut. His Lady would hopefully praise him for making the contact easier for her.</p><p>The most important part was that he had finished his namestone. He could not wait to present it to his Lady at the earliest opportunity upon his return!</p><p>To his growing frustration, there was still no opportunity to meet, even when Flutrane’s waters washed away the reign of Ewigeliebe.</p><p>He nearly lost his composure when it was time for Lord Wilfried’s baptism and his Lady stepped up to stand behind his right shoulder after her greeting to said waste of space.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne was… standing in the position of a …subordinate… to <em> Wilfried? </em></p><p>Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Unforgivable! How dare he! How dare they!!!</p><p>It took all of his self control to not openly show his emotions. Did the archducal family already begin to exploit his Lady’s endless blessings? Was she used to prop up their useless heir against her will again? What about her reputation being stained by serving a boy? A useless puppet of his own grandmother at that.</p><p>He did his best not to seethe when he saw said Chaocipher leading them outside after her puppet failed at even completing the simple task of greeting everyone without someone holding his hands. Maybe he should spare his Lady the pain and just remove him from the picture altogether? Poison maybe?</p><p>’No, I have to ask my Lady first. Keep calm. Deep breaths.’</p><p>Seeing his magnificent Lady needing to defer to that useless waste of her compassion was still slightly painful to watch.</p><p>The biggest blow to him so far was when he discovered the newest gossip traveling around like wildfire.</p><p>Apparently Angelica had officially entered Lady Rozemyne’s service as her personal apprentice knight. Swearing her name to her to achieve this very goal just this winter! It was like a punch directly into his gut as he despaired at his missed chance. Even his delay in contacting his Lady could not excuse his failure, as Angelica swore herself into service while the Royal Academy was <em> still ongoing!</em></p><p>There was no chance for him at all, as he was still in the creation process at the time! How was he beaten to it by <em> Angelica </em> of all people?! Madness!</p><p>Was this his punishment by the Gods for being such a failure in the last weave? The sheer envy he felt as he saw the pale-blue haired fool following Lady Rozemyne around like a newborn wolfaniel, the pure joy on her face obvious to everyone, was indescribable. It was even worse as his Lady’s retinue seemed to grow with every season too!</p><p>Even worse was the fact that some children of comparable age even seemed <em> interested </em> in the concept of serving his Lady as well! On the occasion he spoke to Leonore, she lamented that nearly <em> all </em> female apprentice knights idolized Lady Rozemyne <em> already! </em> The most vocal of them being Judithe – which was unsurprising – and Lady Natalie, who became Lady Charlotte’s retainer in the past, which was more troubling.</p><p>By the Gods, even Matthias and Laurenz were eyeing her curiously at the awarding ceremony already!</p><p>First Tuuliane, then Gretia and Lieseleta. Now Angelica, and the others. At this rate he would be left behind! He had to become like Steifebriese, before even more people saw Lady Rozemyne’s obvious divinity and decided to act before he got the chance! But how?!</p><p>“To think that girl would swear her name to Lady Rozemyne…”</p><p>“I heard that Lady Rozemyne is blessed by many Gods. Meanwhile Angelica seemed to be struggling in her education, if rumors are to be believed, so it is a bit drastic but understandable she would seek help. Is it not?”</p><p>Cornelius seemed to ponder over his answer before giving his reply.</p><p>“Still an extreme measure in my opinion. Did you know Lady Rozemyne recently started sparring with older members of the Knight’s Order? So far she is undefeated, and Traugott is looking at her with that look… I do not like it at all.”</p><p>“Interesting. Is she truly as capable as rumors describe her as? I find them humorously over the top.”</p><p>He did not care much for Cornelius’s rafel to be honest. He did not expect his next words though.</p><p>“Why do you not join me for the next exercise and see for yourself, then? If anything, those rumors are too modest.”</p><p>Hartmut blinked. Join him for training? Why should he…</p><p>Wait, that was it!</p><p>He would use this chance to try to speak to his Lady. Surely no one would suspect a thing if he dressed it as curiosity after seeing her tear down her opponents!</p><p>“A curious proposition. When will the next meeting be?”</p><p>“Tomorrow, actually.”</p><p>“Much sooner than expected, but still doable I think.”</p><p>His mother was at first not pleased by the sudden change of his schedule, but after hearing it was an invitation from Cornelius, she changed her tone easily enough. In his eagerness he was one of the first to arrive on the training grounds, earning him an eye roll from his childhood friend.</p><p>“Why are you so early, Hartmut? Are you that eager to see her?”</p><p>“Says the one who was here even earlier than myself.”</p><p>Cornelius at least had the decency to look slightly abashed upon his verbal riposte. Hartmut looked around, noticing a few senior apprentice knights were comparing notes about something with hushed whispers. Sadly, he could not hear them with all the noises around, a shame. </p><p>Aside from the occasional banter with his friend, nothing worth noting happened until he spotted Lord Guthfried dropping to the ground on his highbeast, Lady Rozemyne seated just before him, both of them dismounted from their transport with grace.</p><p>Instantly he became aware that <em>everyone</em> present seemed to fall into silence. Some even straightened their backs, causing him to blink. Lady Rozemyne’s mere presence had this much of an impact already? He did not expect their unruly Knight’s Order to recognize his Lady’s splendor this easily.</p><p>Seeing as it was nearly time to start, he wished Cornelius farewell for now and positioned himself at the sidelines to not disturb the exercise. He did prepare to use his knowledge of enhancement to sharpen his ears for any interesting piece of information, however. Lord Karstedt’s arrival should have been the moment things started, but curiously, he just seemed tired to find the Order already at attention upon his arrival. All he did was send a glance to Lady Rozemyne, who was smiling innocently as she stood prominently in the center of the apprentices of the Veronica faction.</p><p>Seeing the knights train was fairly disappointing in comparison to what he had seen being performed by knights of Dunkelfelger. He had to get used to the idea of them not receiving the wisdom of his Lady for now. He shuddered as the memory of the training from Lady Hannelore came to mind – who would have expected the soft spoken Lady to be that cruel? He dismissed the traumatizing thought as Lady Rozemyne took to the field, standing opposite of Eckhart of all people…</p><p>Was that truly a good idea? He was a scary opponent, using any tactic available to him. On closer inspection, they were just using wooden weapons, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>Said relief vanished fairly quickly as the simple spar devolved into real combat. Eckhart even threw real daggers at his Lady! The only consolation was that Lady Rozemyne appeared unfazed, parrying not only his blows but the small blades with a mere wooden sword as well! </p><p>As much as he wished to continue watching his Lady, who was clearly on her way to regain her former prowess, he instead turned his attention towards those watching the “duel” to gather some information. Being useful to his Lady had to come before his own desires, after all.</p><p>He blinked when he noticed the open expression of awe and adoration on the faces of the younger apprentice knights. Did they forget their lessons about hiding one’s emotions? Nearly every Lady knight was looking at his lady with sparkles in their eyes, by the gods, some had even clasped their hands not dissimilar to Angelica when she was moved. There even was a girl nearly jumping in place, her true feelings clear for all to see! Upon closer inspection he recognized her as Lady Natalie, one of Lady Charlotte’s future guard knights.</p><p>A second look revealed that Judithe was similarly impressed as she seemed to nearly swoon at the sight. At least that proved that his information was correct so far. There was no need to mention that nearly every young lord was looking at his Lady with traces of Bluanfah’s visit in their eyes. They would experience the feeling of heartbreak soon enough, then.</p><p>After the “duel” ended in his Lady’s favor, it was nearly time to end the exercise, allowing him to approach Cornelius once again. As he came nearer, there was apparently a commotion breaking out, centering around Lady Rozemyne.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it seemed the young apprentice boys he noticed earlier had surrounded his Lady, and were passionately discussing something with her, with the adults and the female knights nodding along in agreement. It was only when he got close enough that he could pick up some of the discussion.</p><p>“…and so we were hoping you would be willing to honour us with a performance dedicated to Angriff.”</p><p>One of the boys – Hartmut was not sure what his name was, but he was among the Veronican apprentices – finished the plea of the group. Were they hoping for a sword dance?</p><p>“Oh my, to think you would value my singing so highly that you feel just one song would empower your battles so… Why, I am honoured, however…”</p><p>Ah, so they were asking his Lady to sing. It was of course expected, her voice itself was like a blessing sent from the Gods, even without any mana. And her blessings when she prayed sincerely while singing were a wonder to behold. He was happy his peers already understood her divinity this early. However, his Lady placed a hand on her cheek in a picture of distress as she continued her answer.</p><p>“I couldn’t possibly offend the Gods by offering the song you requested with no accompaniment. If only I had my harspiel with me… I suppose if Dregarnuhr spins our threads to cross when Kunstzeal blesses us with her presence…”</p><p>“Actually, Lady Rozemyne, I do believe someone has a harspiel here for practice after training. Allow me to have a servant fetch it for you.”</p><p>Laurenz of all people offered his Lady the solution to everyone’s delight. The look Lady Rozemyne gave her former retainer was quite an interesting one. Hartmut was sure that at the same age in the last weave, she would have pouted at his teasing grin, however she simply gave him her most noble smile with a piercing glare.</p><p>A simple wave summoned the servant carrying the instrument. He did a double take as he noticed the person in question was not a servant of Laurenz or one of the Veronicans, but of Cornelius! Carrying Cornelius’ own harspiel…</p><p>He looked at his friend in disbelief. Cornelius, for his part, simply looked away, avoiding eye contact. He could not be serious…</p><p>“Ah, how<em> convenient. </em> In that case, I would be happy to offer a song to Angriff. I am, of course, certain that none of you would request such an effort from me with no offer of compensation, so I am curious to hear what bounty you have gathered to offer in return.”</p><p>Before any of the knights could respond, Lord Guthried spoke up in a huff.</p><p>“My daughter is no musician to take requests, and she is an archnoble on top of that. I doubt you have anything worthwhile to offer her. If you are that desperate to hear her singing, you need to offer up your spoil from the recent subjugation of the Lord of Winter as the bare minimum.”</p><p>Apparently Lord Guthfried was not aware how prepared and eager those hearing the whispers of Bluanfah could get. The knights and apprentices simply exchanged some quick glances before nodding to each other. At least they showed they understood the value of his divine Lady, although Hartmut would have placed an even higher value on such a shameless request.</p><p>“Of course, this is more than agreeable. What do you say, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>His Lady just looked exasperated at this point.</p><p>“Very well. If you truly desire to receive the blessings of Angriff through Kunstzeal, I suppose that is sufficient compensation for one song.”</p><p>Lord Guthfried looked shocked and angry in equal measure. But now that he himself had laid down the terms and they were accepted, there was little he could do. In contrast, Cornelius looked quite pleased with himself. Hartmut did not know how to feel about it.</p><p>At least he had the opportunity to witness his divine Lady's glorious singing once again. Thankfully nobody fainted this time – preventing any chaos that could stop him from approaching her. He <em> finally </em> got his chance to speak with her, using praise for her singing as a valid excuse.</p><p>“It was a wonderful way to praise the Gods indeed, Lady Rozemyne. I myself struggle to find the opportunity or place to do so.”</p><p>“Is that so, …?”</p><p>“Ah, forgive me, I am Hartmut. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the pure rivers flowing from Flutrane, the Goddess of Water?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O Flutrane, Goddess of Water. May you grant this fortuitous meeting your blessing."</p><p>As he stood up, he noticed Lord Guthfried was watching him. He had to make it seem as natural as possible.</p><p>“As I was saying, your performance was quite wonderful, Lady Rozemyne. As a future scholar, I have never had the chance to hear Kunstzeal’s delivery of Angriff’s protection before. The song brought to mind an image of knights and soldiers protecting our precious ivory buildings. I am sure it ignited passion in all the knights here.”</p><p>He was sure that he saw the signs of recognition flash briefly in his Lady’s eyes.</p><p>“My, that is quite the unique compliment, Lord Hartmut. I believe the appreciation of Kunstzeal is even more rare even among knights. But I am sure that both the Goddess and Angriff were pleased by the passion of the knights training today.”</p><p>“Is that so? Then I must thank you for your kindness in sharing this blessing with us. I pity the poor souls who do not receive such mercy.”</p><p>“You are too kind, Lord Hartmut. I simply satisfied my fellow knight’s curiosity and my own desire to try my hand at brewing.”</p><p>His Lady obviously understood his hidden message as she gave him the opportunity to speak on a different topic that he could use to offer a timeframe.</p><p>“Then I shall hold you up no longer, Lady Rozemyne. I imagine you shall be busy brewing for the next few days, after receiving such a wonderful bounty for your singing. If I may be so bold, please do remember to get some fresh air after some time. It is no good for a scholar to spend more than three days on research without a break.”</p><p>His Lady nodded at him, confirming her agreement to meet him in the location of the monastery in Hasse in three days.</p><p>“How kind of you to be concerned for my health, Lord Hartmut. Perhaps I shall take your advice and gather some ingredients myself as a break.”</p><p>“A wonderful idea. May Schlageziel bless you until Dregarnuhr intersects our threads once more.”</p><p>He said his farewell, trying to sound as casual and indifferent as he remembered being like in his memories, but his heart was beating so fast in his chest. He barely paid any mind to the curious eyes around him. He just hoped that he managed to convey his message clearly enough for his Lady to understand. She was of course far beyond any mere mortal in intellect, but whether his skills of conveying a secret message in his conversation were up to par still remained to be seen.</p><p>After his departure, Dregarnuhr spun her thread at an excruciatingly slow pace, before the day he suggested finally arrived. After saying goodbye to his parents for a meeting he fabricated in its stead he mounted his highbeast and took to the sky.</p><p>The flight to the meeting was thankfully uneventful. He had no desire to disappoint his Lady with having to deal with complications after all.</p><p>As he approached the clearing beside the river, he spied some figures standing just beside the riverbed in the shadow of a tree. Relieved that he was successful in requesting a meeting with his Lady, he steered his highbeast in the direction of the figures. He landed a respectful distance away, dismounting his ride and reverting its form back to its usual stone before he began his approach.</p><p>Contrary to his earlier thoughts, his Lady was not standing but currently seated on a rock protruding out of the ground. He shamelessly took a moment of time to closely inspect her.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne wore a slightly modified light armor set, normally worn by knights. The skirt part was cut slightly in length, reaching just below her knees. Of course her brilliance urged her to use the appropriate length for her outward age. She was currently lacking any sort of cape, which was understandable, if slightly worrying. He just hoped she was protected in less obvious ways instead. A short dagger rested prominently on her hip – most likely a manablade. It was a bit strange to look at his Lady wearing the uniform normally worn by knights, her beautiful combat armor was still fresh in his mind’s eye. The uniform just felt …subpar in comparison. Unworthy to be worn by someone this holy.</p><p>She was currently busy spoiling the zantze he heard she kept as a pet, with gentle strokes of its ears, not acknowledging his presence. Beside her was Angelica, who was watching him with suspicion – her hand on her weapon. He approved of her attitude. He would have reacted similarly were he in her place. The safety and happiness of his Lady was the most important thing in this God-forsaken garden of theirs.</p><p>He measured his steps and knelt before his Lady in a show of submission as he began to give his greeting. He could <em> feel </em> the weight of his Lady’s gaze landing on him as he began to speak. It was hard not to smile.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, I am glad that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, crossed our threats once again. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the pure rivers flowing from Flutrane, the Goddess of Water?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O Flutrane, Goddess of Water. May you grant this most fortuitous meeting your blessing.”</p><p>He felt bad that his blessing was lacking so much. Working hard with his Lady’s soft compression method would hopefully help to regain his former might soon. But it would suffice for now, there were more important matters to address first. He remained kneeling on the ground as he raised his head, his Lady had, after all, not granted him leave to raise yet.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne in turn simply tapped her pet on the back, which resulted in the small creature climbing up his Lady's body to its master’s shoulder. It was a curious sight, if nothing else. It seemed his Lady had discovered another of her boundless blessings in taming the feybeast this thoroughly.</p><p>Suddenly a blue barrier started to erect itself around them, the control of the array resting in his Lady’s lap. She had hidden the device with her pet’s body, how brilliant! He felt a smidge of shame for not noticing the outlining parts of the tool before. Even if he was eager to greet his Lady, it was no excuse to have failed in such a simple task. He had to do better in the future!</p><p>“Angelica.”</p><p>“Yes, Milady?”</p><p>He was a bit confused as to why Lady Rozemyne would address her knight first instead of him, was it maybe because he failed to be the first to offer his name to her? She took out a small namestone, most likely Angelica’s.</p><p>“You will not tell anyone about this meeting, or what will be discussed, until I state otherwise.”</p><p>Angelica bowed while crossing her arms in submission as she received the command by name. He felt so jealous!</p><p>“As you command, my Lady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne put away the namestone before speaking again.</p><p>“You may stay inside the barrier to guard me.”</p><p>“Thank you so much, Milady!”</p><p>His envy rose to nearly unbearable levels by seeing his Lady’s gracious nature in full display. He wanted to offer his name immediately, the stone felt so heavy in his pocket now.</p><p>“You should know how inappropriate it is to request the presence of a young Lady like myself in a secret meeting like this, Lord Hartmut.”</p><p>“Please disregard any form of courtesy, my Lady. I am – and will always be – your faithful servant. Not even Dregarnuhr herself can sever those bonds of loyalty. I am yours to command, as always.”</p><p>His Lady seemed unimpressed by his answer, but out of the corner of his eyes he saw Angelica looking at him with wide eyes. He ignored her to focus all of his attention on his Lady instead.</p><p>“Hm, how fortuitous a meeting it is indeed. Let us dispense with Grammaratur’s dance.”</p><p>He could only nod, speaking plainly was his main goal anyway.</p><p>“I cannot thank you enough for your leniency, my Lady. Let me first apologize for not presenting you my name sooner. I do not want to excuse myself for my tardiness, but acquiring the necessary ingredients in secret proved more difficult than I anticipated. Please forgive me.”</p><p>He took out the box containing his namestone and offered it to his Lady, in trepidation. He just hoped he had not disappointed her with his tardiness.</p><p>“Oh my, you want me to accept your name right now? How shameless can you be?”</p><p>The small frown on the corner of her lips caused a slightly cold feeling in his stomach. He hurriedly tried to apologize.</p><p>“Again, I humbly beg your forgiveness, my Lady. I long for nothing more than to enter your service again. I will serve you even more faithfully this time.”</p><p>“I do not doubt your faith in me, Hartmut. But I wonder…”</p><p>Cold dread filled his veins like ice from Schneeahst himself as Lady Rozemyne looked at him with a frown on her lips, her beautiful golden eye’s regarding him with coldness!</p><p>“Why should I allow you to serve me this time? I do remember your …eagerness… bringing me no small amount of …inconveniences. Name me a reason why I should accept your service this time.”</p><p>It was even worse than he had feared. His failure in the last weave bore even heavier consequences than expected! He bowed as low as he could.</p><p>“I am aware of my failings and will do my utmost to not disappoint you again, my Lady. Please give me another chance to prove my usefulness!”</p><p>“A question then. What will you do, should I allow you into my service?”</p><p>“I will only act according to your will. Of course I will not burden you with inconsequential details, but I will never act on my own delusions of what would be best for you again, my Lady.”</p><p>He just hoped he could be forgiven for his past transgression, his Lady’s mercy was not unending after all. He slightly despaired at the mere thought of being cut loose. Dregarnuhr spun her weave painfully slowly as he stared at the ground in fear of the potential rejection.</p><p>“… You did serve me well after your last reprimand, so very well. But this is your last chance, Hartmut. If you will scheme behind my back again, I will send you to greet the Supreme Couple myself, regardless of the consequences. Understood?”</p><p>Relief flooded him as he was given another chance to serve his Lady! He was maybe a bit too eager in his nodding, but he just felt pure happiness.</p><p>“I swear it, my Lady! I will not disappoint you this time!”</p><p>“Give me your namestone.”</p><p>“At once!”</p><p>He tried to remain graceful as he presented the box to his Lady a second time. It took not long before he felt the beginnings of Lady Rozemyne’s beautiful mana begin to envelop him again. Ignoring the pain was easy enough until it suddenly felt as if the whole world was trying to crush him, causing him to release a muted grunt. The crushing feeling was similar to what he remembered as he was forced on the ground, barely able to remain upright by using his arms. To his disappointment, it vanished nearly as fast as it appeared. It still took him a few moments before he was able to straighten and fix his composure.</p><p>The feeling of his Lady’s mana was like feeling a long lost companion returning to his side, but he did note a slight difference to his memories. It felt more …assured? It was hard to describe.</p><p>“My Lady, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will serve you to the best of my meager abilities. Your mana is as potent and beautiful as ever, but there is a slight difference? I do not know how to properly explain it.”</p><p>“Of course there is a difference. I am my parent’s daughter.”</p><p>Of course! How stupid of him! Lady Rozemyne was born as a noble this time, not as a Devouring commoner, making her color more stable. He wondered if she was still omni-elemental regardless? Most likely, as the feeling was nearly the same. He would see the results in his third year anyway, there was no need to rush.</p><p>“I thank you for enlightening me, my Lady. But now I have a much more important question for you. I do confess it has plagued me for days on end.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>His Lady’s slightly raised eyebrow spoke of her intrigue. It was such a relief to see the familiar sight!</p><p>“What are your wishes for the future, my Lady?”</p>

    <p>After the winter playroom ended, Rozemyne suddenly found herself with a lot of free time on her hands. Was this how a normal noble would spend their day? She was beginning to truly understand what they meant about her earlier treatment better than ever before.</p><p>Just a few days later she was given a new book by her father, about manablades of all things, which naturally led to her being permitted to create her own. It took her a lot of restraint to limit her work only to what she could feasibly know from the books in the mansion, but she let herself go wild in picking the form. Using a Katana sounded not only cool but it would serve as a constant reminder of her roots in her now Yurgenschmidt-dominated personality.</p><p>She could not stop feeling that something was off, however, as she tested her new creation with a few swings. After summoning Jenni for her opinion, she performed a rudimentary blade dance, but still, there was just something off. She could not place her finger on it for the life of her. After much trial and error, she finally realized what troubled her that much.</p><p>She was simply too young. Her muscle memory was used to her old stature for any serious blade-work, forming a strange disconnect between her mind and body. Realizing that fixing this issue meant she had to relearn everything she already knew did not fill her with any excitement at all. At least her retainers seemed to like even such a simple performance, which was something.</p><p>Just a day after the end of the term of the Royal Academy, her dear Angelica returned, practically glowing with pride for having finished the year without the need for remedial classes. Considering the past, it was truly astounding even to Rozemyne herself. So she rewarded her loyal knight, and scheduled a meeting where she would give her mana to Angelica’s blade. It was a bit confusing to see the older girl so touched by her words. She was just upholding her earlier promise.</p><p>When it was time and she took her airheaded knight’s blade in her hands, she could not help but reminisce about the past a bit. Holding “Stenluke” again was familiar. The blade she used so much lay comfortably in her hands, even if it brought with it the memories of the past.</p><p>‘No, forget it. It will never happen. I will prevent it this time.’</p><p>“Is there something specific that you desire, Angelica? Some aptitudes you are lacking, blade length or something else?”</p><p>“Ah, I would be overjoyed with whatever you seem appropriate, Milady. Eep!”</p><p>She stopped her inspection of the blade to look sternly at Angelica. She needed to help Angelica improve as much as possible, she could not fail her knight like that again… The easiest place to start was her obvious flaws, even if it was a long way from saving her from her previous fate.</p><p>“That will <em> not </em>do. What aptitudes do you currently have, Angelica?”</p><p>“F–Fire and Wind, Milady!”</p><p>“Hm, how fitting for my blade and shield.”</p><p>Rozemyne could only sigh at her airheaded knight. Imagining what she needed to do for the poor girl was already making her exhausted. At least she would be omni-elemental thanks to the name swearing. Maybe she could expand her list of protections too? It was worth considering at least. </p><p>“I will make sure that you will receive the correlating protections, I will not allow you to fail in this regard. Now, clearly state to me what your own desires for your blade are.”</p><p>“Yes, Milady! I want my blade to have as many elements as I can. I began feeding it Earth attribute feystones from defeated feybeasts just recently, but I have not seen any results so far.”</p><p>Rozemyne gave Angelica a well-meant rebuke while she still had her full attention. She may have knowledge of the future, but she could not act upon that knowledge as freely as she would have liked before needing to make up excuses.</p><p>“Tell me your desires when I specifically ask for them in the future, Angelica. I cannot fulfill them if I do not know them.”</p><p>“Understood. I am sorry.”</p><p>She concentrated on the blade a bit, looking for any imperfection. But it seemed as well maintained as she expected. Placing her hand on the feystone, she closed her eyes before beginning to channel her mana into the blade, making sure to keep her head clear of any thoughts.</p><p>There was no need for another accident. Stenluke would simply not be created this time, not that she had any access to Ferdinand’s mana anyway. </p><p>After the process was finished she handed the blade back to its rightful owner.</p><p>“I imbued it with my mana, mostly focusing on the aspects that you are lacking. I filled it just slightly under the capacity I could feel within, but please make sure to give it some more of your own mana to ensure your ownership.”</p><p>“Yes! I cannot thank you enough, Milady. I cannot wait to see how it will feel to wield a blade filled with your beautiful mana! Oh, how wonderful! Maybe we could even have a spar? Please, Milady!”</p><p>She was about to reprimand her airheaded knight again when a voice suddenly spoke up from the blade.</p><p>“How can you talk to your lady that way? Please mind your speech! I am so sorry about my master, master of my master. Please forgive her.”</p><p>As her retainers reacted to the phenomenon, she simply stared at the weapon. She was sure the only reason Stenluke happened in the first place was her explicit wish the last time, so how was this possible? Frustration was mixing with her confusion as she tried to trace back her steps and find where she went wrong.</p><p>“I was born from Lady Rozemyne’s mana, the master of my master.”</p><p>That did not help her confusion at all.</p><p>“I was infusing the blade with my mana and <em> specifically </em> only wished it to be imbued with additional elements. Also, why do you speak in Lieseleta’s voice now?”</p><p>“Anhaltung works in mysterious ways. Also, it was my master’s sister’s mana inside me and the firm desire to protect and guide her sister which gave me her voice.”</p><p>She ignored everyone around her as she now glared at the damned weapon. Her confusion was replaced by anger as she began to realize what had most likely happened. It was hard to hold her usual composure. The Gods had interfered with her life. <em> Again. </em> Even worse, they targeted one of her beloved retainers!</p><p>“Anhaltung should only act <em> for </em> the Goddess of Light, not freely in her domain, she is but a pillar after all. And while <em> my </em>pillar may need her guidance, she shall pray for it when Gebordnung compels her to.”</p><p>If “Stenluke” had an open channel to the Gods, she could use that to maybe tell them to go bother someone else.</p><p>“My master is favored not only by Leidenschaft, Angriff and Schutzaria, but Gebordnung as well. It is only right that Anhaltung places her protection to support her fellow subordinate. The Goddess of Light wishes to support the servants of the cho–”</p><p>
  <em> “Silence!” </em>
</p><p>Her anger boiled over. How dare they manipulate <em> her </em> retainers! They had no right! Angelica swore her name to her. She belonged to Rozemyne now, and no one else! Their interference in the last weave had only led to pain and misery, she would <u><b> <em>not</em> </b></u> allow it to happen again!</p><p>“Their care is an Ewigeliebe out of season. Ice has no place in summer, the kin of Leidenschaft belongs only in his domain. Duldsetzen's blessings are only so powerful, Nyx's creation nearly summoned Verfuhremeer already. Any more, and I fear neither Goddess could calm the fire that would be unleashed.”</p><p>“I am simply the messenger, master of my master.”</p><p>It was hard to contain her emotions as the fates of everyone she cherished in her last life flashed before her eyes. </p><p>“Milady, you are Crushing the others.”</p><p>Angelica’s comment took Rozemyne out of her daydream. She took a deep breath to center herself, trying to banish those painful memories to the depths of her mind where they belonged.</p><p>“If the Supreme Couple wishes to know of me, then you can be their Ordoschnelli, and remind them of the threads Dregarnuhr intersected. Tell them they will be greeting that little spawn of Ewigeliebe in a different manner if the weave repe–”</p><p>“I am sad to say I am unable to do that. I was given the message before I was created, but there is no further connection, master of my master. My apologies for my failure to assist you.”</p><p>She scowled at the answer. So she was barred from speaking to them as well? Was that petty brat hiding from her? She should have ended her when she had the chance, instead of agreeing to this farce. Maybe she should send a nasty prayer instead? Or a curse? Would that even work? It was worth a try at least.</p><p>“…Fine. If you speak of it ever again, I will undo Vulcanift’s work myself, understand?”</p><p>“Perfectly, master of my master.”</p><p>She looked up at Angelica next, taking her namestone into her hands before channeling her mana into it. Even if she spoke in heavy euphemistic language, the risk of a potential leak of her past was too great a risk. She did not like using the namestone for small things, but it was important to swear Angelica never to ask about what she heard from her manablade. With that done, she wanted to escape to her hidden room immediately, but Angelica’s question interrupted her.</p><p>“Um, Milady, a question. If I may?”</p><p>
  <em> “...Yes?” </em>
</p><p>She felt a bit bad for exposing them to her foul mood, but why was Angelica not allowing her to retreat?</p><p>“May I be permitted to name my mana blade Ledelys?”</p><p>The question stumped her, derailing her thoughts a bit. She was not going to call it Stenluke?</p><p>“You want to name your blade Ledelys?”</p><p>“Only if you permit me to, Milady.”</p><p>What did it matter in the end?</p><p>“…You may do so.”</p><p>After entering her hidden room, fruitlessly attempting to destroy the wall with her blade, she at least felt somewhat better. She really needed to find another outlet for her anger instead of destroying things…</p><p>At least there was nothing else worth of note until spring arrived. The only annoying thing was that Wilfried’s baptism was just around the corner, meaning her being his head knight would become open knowledge. Even if some rumors were already making the rounds, it would just be annoying to deal with.</p><p>After officially introducing herself to him at the baptism behind those of higher rank than her, and taking a place behind him, she at least got a good perspective on the reaction of everyone. Unsurprisingly, nearly everyone seemed confused or displeased about seeing her there. The only one happy about it was Veronica.</p><p>Just a few minutes into the greeting procedure, she realized that Wilfried was showing signs of unrest. Was he thinking about running away? That would not do, she would end up somehow taking the blame for it for sure.</p><p>She subtly closed the distance between them before placing her hand on his right shoulder, just below his cape. Using enhancement magic, she was able to prevent his escape, even when he got obvious about it. She was starting to worry about how <em> that </em> would be used against her, when Veronica intervened.</p><p>“Oh my dear Wilfried, could I speak with you for a moment?”</p><p>Wilfried stopped his futile struggle when Veronica addressed him, looking at the woman instead.</p><p>“I– um.”</p><p>Who would have thought she would feel a bit thankful to <em> Veronica </em>of all people? Well, being related to Wilfried, regardless how minor it was, meant they apparently all got to enjoy his behavior.</p><p>Rozemyne only removed her hold on her “charge” when Veronica glanced at her. Taking the hint she also stepped back to the appropriate distance of a guard knight.</p><p>After a firm, but in her opinion much too gentle scolding, the whole thing ended without anything important of note. Even if she was surprised that Veronica praised her for her efforts of containing Wilfried, the praise felt as hollow as her goodwill.</p><p>The clear display of her new position led to Bonifatius insisting that she should fight the senior members of the Knight Order to get their respect.</p><p>She agreed of course, but so far everyone she sparred with was just substandard. She had high hopes when she got the opportunity to fight Eckhart, but sadly he was similarly disappointing, even if she could agree wholeheartedly that he stood slightly above his father. Those throwing blades nearly caught her off guard a few times.</p><p>The sight of her “fanclub” made her nearly smile though. Judithe seemed so happy. It was relieving to see her so carefree again.</p><p>Rozemyne felt slightly exasperated when they tried to bribe her into singing a song for them, even preparing a harspiel and offering their remaining spoils from the Lord of Winter subjugation.</p><p>She was distracted from her thoughts when Hartmut of all people approached her. Of course she had noticed him earlier, but she had assumed he was here because of Cornelius. After exchanging greetings, she looked at him more closely. </p><p>Why was he approaching her now of all times?</p><p>He opened the conversation with the strangest compliment. He was, of course, always strange with his praise, but why would he include soldiers and ivory buildings of all things? Wait… could it be that he had his old memories as well? She responded neutrally, to see if he said anything else that could be taken as a hint.</p><p>“Is that so? Then I must thank you for your kindness in sharing this blessing with us. I pity the poor souls who do not receive such mercy.”</p><p>Another hidden hint was all the confirmation she needed. He seemed to have his memories of the past weave, using his knowledge to agree on a meeting spot. There was no monastery of Hasse, so only someone with knowledge of the last weave would even hint at it to her. But how to agree on a time to meet without being too obvious? The sight of some knights reminded her of her new spoils, giving her an idea.</p><p>“You are too kind, Lord Hartmut. I simply satisfied my fellow knight’s curiosity and my own desire to try my hand at brewing.”</p><p>“Then I shall hold you up no longer, Lady Rozemyne. I imagine you shall be busy brewing for the next few days, after receiving such a wonderful bounty for your singing. If I may be so bold, please do remember to get some fresh air after some time. It is no good for a scholar to spend more than three days on research without a break.”</p><p>She nodded at him. Three days should be more than enough time to change up her schedule for a trip outside the city. She gave her confirmation subtly before allowing the conversation to wind down to farewells.</p><p>As she watched him go, she turned to her dad to leave too, and soon they made their way back to the estate. No one questioned her sudden desire to gather ingredients. Angelica even seemed delighted at the idea to guard her on the trip.</p><p>She considered refusing at first and making the trip alone, but Angelica was namesworn to her. She could order her to silence, so what was the harm? </p><p>Three days later, Rozemyne was dressed in her knight uniform and light armor, before making her way out of the mansion, Hisui on her shoulder. Angelica did not even question her when she pulled out her highbeast, simply marveling at Nyx.</p><p>“Your highbeast looks so powerful, Milady! I confess I feel kind of envious now…”</p><p>“Do you want to ride with me?”</p><p>It would just be faster. She did not know if Hartmut was already waiting, after all. Angelica swirled her head to stare at her with sparkles in her eyes. So bright…</p><p>“Really? You do not mind? Is it not improper?”</p><p>“Why should it? Both of us are girls. You are my knight and swore your name to me. There is no one I would trust my back more to currently.”</p><p>Angelica looked touched at her little speech, but she only spoke the truth. Ignoring the swooning airhead, Rozemyne jumped on the back of her bowing highbeast, taking the reins in her hands after sitting comfortably. Hisui simply jumped down into her lap and made herself comfortable.</p><p>“Just sit behind me and hold on tight.”</p><p>“Yes! Thank you, Milady!”</p><p>After Angelica climbed up and hugged her from behind, she indicated for Nyx to take them to their destination. A few powerful flaps of her wings took them to the air in mere seconds, beginning to accelerate as Rozemyne pumped more mana into her. The winds were stronger than expected, but the raised head of her transport worked wonders to reduce them to a bearable quantity. Arriving at Hasse took just a few minutes. Spying the location the monastery would be, she steered towards it and landed just beside the river.</p><p>After dismounting, seeing a rock in the shade of a tree made her smile – this was just a perfect place to wait. Seeing as there was no sign of Hartmut so far, she instructed Angelica to set up the soundblocker around them as she sat down. Seeing the confused expression on Angelica’s face, she informed her of the real reason for the trip, making her look sad that there would be no hunting for now.</p><p>“You can still guard me. That is why I brought you with me in the first place.”</p><p>That cheered her right up. Rozemyne took the time to think, beginning to pet Hisui on her lap in the meanwhile. After the barrier pieces were set up, she hid the control piece under her pet, out of sight, should anyone else interrupt them here. As unlikely as that was, there was nothing wrong with preparing for the eventuality. </p><p>It took longer than she would have liked, but Hartmut eventually landed in the clearing. Good. She was beginning to get bored.</p><p>“Milady.”</p><p>“I know, remain on your guard but do not do anything without my permission.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The following conversation with her overzealous scholar played out nearly exactly as expected. She just wished there were more of her people remembering the past.</p><p>After harshly scolding him a little, she regardless took his name back into her possession. At least he did not act in the same creepy way as before, reacting more like anyone else having sworn their name to her. Had he finally grown up and learned to temper his obsession?</p><p>…Who was she kidding, that was just impossible, maybe the changed nature of her mana was the reason?</p><p>“What are your wishes for the future, my Lady?”</p><p>It truly seemed that he had learned his lesson. She felt kind of bad about being so harsh to him now, but on the other hand Hartmut required her to be strict with him. Otherwise he would run amok with his endless worship of her person. She dismissed those thoughts as she looked at her last – now first and only scholar.</p><p>“My wishes… Let me hear your own thoughts about them first. Also, you may rise.”</p><p>Hartmut rose before looking at her with intrigue.</p><p>“You want me to speculate your desires, Milady? But I already failed at exactly this task in the most glorious fashion before…”</p><p>She nodded at him before giving her own explanation.</p><p>“Precisely, I want to see the fruits of your labor in learning to better serve me. Did you not promise so after my first scolding?”</p><p>He flinched at the reminder, averting his eyes to the ground before recovering. His hand holding his chin as he began to voice his own theory of her desires. She felt it only natural to check how adept he was at reading her intentions, now that he had decided he still wanted to serve her.</p><p>“Despite your abundant blessings, I see you have not risen beyond your archnoble status, Milady. I also noticed that you did not grace Ehrenfest with any of your previous inventions.”</p><p>He glanced at her for a moment.</p><p>“I have not heard any talk about your past in the temple, which makes sense with your current status, and you also left just before your baptism. Even if Lord Sylvester announced you as High Priestess, your accomplishments since and your ties to Lord Bonifatius have put a stop to that news spreading far.”</p><p>She nodded at his summary, everything was correct so far.</p><p>“In fact, you seem to be only connected to the archducal family through Lord Bonifatius, and he is only the relay aub. Your support of the rest of them is practically non-existent compared to the past. Well, aside from Wilfried. Pardon, Lord Wilfried… Who, of course, is wholly unworthy to even gaze upon your divine self. I wish to understand how you plan to use your connection to him and Lady Veronica.”</p><p>She wanted to grimace just like him, but she had better control than that now.</p><p>“Later. For now, continue.”</p><p>“Of course, Milady. Then, I also noticed a difference in your mana. Your control of your divine blessings is even more impressive than before, to be able to dim your bright light to match us mere mortals around you is truly a wonder.”</p><p>Hartmut smiled at her.</p><p>“Your beautiful mana nearly crushed me as you accepted my name. Your divinity is simply a marvel to behold!”</p><p>She was almost regretting telling him to continue, but she wanted to get to the important part of this conversation first.</p><p>“There is also the fact that you began gathering parts of your old retinue around you, even going so far as accepting Angelica’s name...”</p><p>He seemed displeased by this for some reason, but she didn’t even deign to address it. Knowing him he was probably just displeased he was not the first to do so.</p><p>“It warms my heart that you recognized the divinity of our Lady this early, Angelica. I believe you are worthy of being tasked with our Lady's protection.”</p><p>Obviously. Rozemyne would make damn sure to train her back up to her own standards as well. </p><p>“While I have seen her attending to you, I do not believe Gretia had the opportunity to create her own namestone yet. Although, you already saved her from her family, so it is only a matter of time.”</p><p>Also true. Gretia was<em> even more </em> zealous in worshiping the ground Rozemyne walked on. She expected her name as soon as the girl had the opportunity to create it.</p><p>”Lieseleta and even your sister are serving you as well. Your parents were rumored to have had a somewhat shaky standing in their faction, until your gracious gift for Lady Veronica. But… Would it not have been more advantageous to offer it to Lady Elvira instead?”</p><p>“Regardless of the Gods meddling with my family, well intentioned or not, they are still my Geduldh and I could not bear to see them suffering under the Trombe. They wished to improve their standing in the faction they feared to oppose, and I was happy to oblige. I have not seen much difference in how Veronica is treating me compared to how Florencia did, I do not expect her faction to be kinder either. Being a Veronican could possibly even be advantageous for my plans this time.”</p><p>Hartmut looked at her with intrigue before carrying on.</p><p>“Indeed, as far as I can tell, you are fostering positive relations with at least Matthias and Laurenz too, using the fact you are part of the Veronica faction. Even if they are limited to matters regarding Angriff, due to the difference in gender. Is that what you referred to, Milady?”</p><p>“In part, yes. But that is not all. I intend to use her reputation as well.”</p><p>His eyes widened slightly as he seemingly came to a conclusion upon her answer.</p><p>“Milady, are you… Are you planning to leave Ehrenfest?”</p><p>She simply smiled at him, keeping her silence.</p><p>“No! Milady, please reconsider! How can I guard you when you are leaving?!”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced to her side, where Angelica was looking at her with shock and sadness.</p><p>“A retainer, and especially a guard knight, will not interrupt any conversation of their master without their express permission.”</p><p>Angelica looked at her like a kicked puppy now, tears gathering in the corner of her eyes. Oh dear.</p><p>“As my namesworn, you will accompany me regardless, Angelica. There is no need for you to worry about not being able to serve me. You’re mine.”</p><p>“Ah! Right. I am sorry for interrupting, Milady.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked back at Hartmut, who seemed overjoyed at the news. What a startling contrast.</p><p>“I cannot truly express my joy at your confirmation of abandoning this backwater duchy, Milady. Ehrenfest is not able to support your splendor! A divine being such as yourself need not to be burdened by such shaky pillars. Considering what happened in the past, they are unworthy of your light!”</p><p>She would have worded it slightly differently, but there was a reason she chose this path after all.</p><p>“You did well in reading my intentions correctly this time, Hartmut.”</p><p>“I am unworthy of your praise, Milady! If I may be so bold as to inquire what duchy you intend to migrate to?”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at her loyal scholar. He should know the answer.</p><p>“That should be more than obvious, Hartmut. There is only one duchy containing what I desire most.” </p><p>“I beg your forgiveness for that redundant inquiry. The Land of Fire is one of the few places being able and worthy enough to receive your boundless blessings. I am sure they will be most eager to secure you, after witnessing even just a part of your divine splendour!”</p><p>She ignored his religious ramblings as she nodded.</p><p>“They are easily swayed by the chance of dittering with a worthy foe. I do not imagine there will be much need for any convoluted plans on our part. Being forced into serving under Wilfried will serve in strengthening my image as an abused genius.”</p><p>She gave him her most beautiful ladies smile as his eyebrow twitched and his smile lost much of its brightness.</p><p>“I have much experience on the matter, don’t you agree? It is not even that bad this time. Veronica may be a vicious Trombe, but she recognizes my worth for her own goals of fixing Wilfried. For now. I plan to use the reputation of Veronica among probable informants in the Royal Academy. Whatever source they confer with will only tell them of my mistreatment by our Archducal family. Placing a few stray messages from <em> Ordoschnelli </em> of my plight will serve to incense them and legitimize my desire to migrate from Ehrenfest.”</p><p>His smile regained its previous brightness, before he bowed his head to her.</p><p>“It will be my utmost pleasure to fulfill everything my Goddess commands. On the topic, are you intending to become Zent as well? It may be below you, but sadly the only position at least somewhat worthy of your attention, Milady.”</p><p>She nearly grimaced at the thought. She had no desire to become Zent again. One time leading a country on the brink of ruin was enough for her. How could he even suggest that when she failed so spectacularly in preventing their doom?</p><p>“There is no need for me to become Zent again. Surely the royal family is able to hold the reins, now that I plan to prevent the worst from happening. If they do not ascend to the towering heights prematurely again, they will find a way. Lady Eglantine is omni-elemental too, she can get her own book. I have no desire to mediate between mortals and the Gods.”</p><p>Hartmut looked at her aghast.</p><p>“But surely you would not miss the chance to acquire your book again, Milady?”</p><p>“I still need it for my plans to prevent what happened last time, Hartmut. There is no way I would miss the opportunity. Even if it belongs to <em> her.” </em></p><p>He nodded hesitantly, before looking at her in trepidation?</p><p>“I beg your forgiveness for my next question. How do you plan to approach Dunkelfelger? I am assured you are already aware, but neither Lady Hannelore nor Lord Lestilaut are the same as before. We do not know how they will react to your new self. They could even start undermining your efforts. It would be best to prepare at least some leverage in advance that could convince Aub Dunkelfelger even if Lady Hannelore and Lord Lestilaut resist.”</p><p>She nearly scowled at him. What did he just say?</p><p>“…Resist?”</p><p>“Yes, Milady. I am aware you may find it hard to imagine your people actively working against your wishes. However, we cannot predict if they will form the same relationships with you this time. Please remember how Lord Lestilaut tried to entrap you through Lord Wilfried. As you are looking your age this time, he may be tempted by not only your beauty but endless blessings as well, or find you dangerous rather than promising. There is no way to know what evil schemes he would–”</p><p>Rozemyne interrupted his tangent, anger beginning to stir inside of her heart. She took out his namestone and removed a miniscule amount of her mana, making him stop as he openly stared at her with an anxious expression. It seemed that her threat was received. She began playing with it in her palm. </p><p>“Oh my, I believe you're overstepping your place, Hartmut. It is not for you to decide on my course of action. Did you forget <em> your own </em> part in that mess of a Ditter? Or do you need a reminder of my …opinion… on your actions?”</p><p>He paled, bowing low before her.</p><p>“My humblest apologies, Milady. There is no need for that!”</p><p>“Hmm. Very well.”</p><p>She kept the stone in her hand, signaling to him that he was still on thin ice on the matter.</p><p>“I recognize that remaining on the side of caution is prudent. I will even allow you to <em> plan </em> those countermeasures. But remain cautious, we do not know if the Gods tampered with them as well. So hold off on implementing anything without my express permission.”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced at Hisui, who still remained on her shoulder, without acknowledging his response. She trusted him enough to not go against her direct orders. There was no need for a command by name for now. She also had to acknowledge that he was right in a way. She gave her lovely pet a soft caress of the head. Hisui in turn purred before jumping away from her, beginning to stalk their immediate surroundings. Focusing back on her earlier thoughts spoiled the sweet moment. She just hoped that her family being nobles now did not mean those meddlesome Gods would manipulate her dear Hannelore and Lestilaut as well…</p><p>“I realize that… they are not mine anymore. At least they still hold Dauerleben’s protection.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence before Hartmut spoke up again.</p><p>“I just wanted to fulfill my duties as your faithful Anhaltung, Milady. Please forgive me for overstepping.”</p><p>“In our world there is little chance of receiving Greifechan’s blessing in the form of a true friend or the true blessings of Bluanfah. Ladies’ society can be even more cruel than you could imagine, Hartmut.”</p><p>She took out Angelica’s namestone to rest in her palm as well. The warm feeling of her treasures doing much to center her. Was it greedy of her to desire all of her old namestones back in her possession? </p><p>“Please do not fret, Milady. Even if they will not give their name to you as before, I am sure you will charm them once again. Please forgive me for doubting you. All of those following in your light are blessed, they will see that. If anything, I believe Lord Lestilaut will be <em> over </em> blessed by Bluanfah upon laying eyes on your divine form walking among the grounds of—”</p><p>She waved him off.</p><p>“Yes, Yes. you already stated your opinion on him more times than I can count.”</p><p>She had no desire to hear another rambling about how no one was worthy of her affections, or how blessed her followers were to receive even part of it.</p><p>“…I just want everyone who served me before to be happy. If I have to live without some of them for this to happen, I am willing to accept it. Regardless of how much it will hurt me. I have seen and caused enough death and misery in the past. I am used to it now. My happiness is irrelevant.” </p><p>She knew she was voicing her inner thoughts, but speaking them out loud made her more sure of herself. The tears rolling down her face, opposing her rhetoric, were annoying. Gods, how pathetic that she was crying again. She was beyond that, she <em>needed </em>to be beyond that.</p><p>“Milady, please don’t cry! We are unworthy of your endless compassion! I beg your forgiveness, but it is <em> your </em> happiness that is the most important thing in the world!”</p><p>Hartmut was looking at her in open worry. He seemed unsure of what to do, aside from rambling about her undeserved happiness. She glanced at Angelica to her side.</p><p>Her loyal knight was looking at her in open worry as well, her eyes alternating between her blade and Rozemyne in indecision.</p><p>‘Fuck it, they belong to me. I already lost my composure, and I can just swear them to silence anyway.’</p><p>“You wish to give me reassurance and happiness? Fine. Angelica.”</p><p>“Yes?!”</p><p>She stood up from the rock currently serving as her seat, dismissing her armor in the process. Feeling a smidge unsure before steeling herself for what she was about to do. She would apologize later.</p><p>“Sit down. I want you to hug me. Remove your armor as well.”</p><p>“At once!”</p><p>Rozemye did not know if she should feel happy or concerned that Angelica followed her order without even the slightest bit of discomfort or hesitance. Her loyal knight sat down on the rock, opening her arms in invitation. Climbing on her lap before feeling arms close around herself was comforting, resting her head against the chest of her first pillar was nice. The position reminded her of a similar situation with Brigitte. Hopefully she will be happy with her upcoming marriage. </p><p>After a bit of wiggling to find the most comfortable position, she settled on happy as she felt the warm comfort of being in the arms of someone she could trust implicitly. She had to talk her mother into giving her hugs later as well. Using the circumstance that she was just a cute little girl practically demanded that she exploited it as much as she could. </p><p>Focusing back on Hartmut, she noticed that he was looking away from them, trying to give them more privacy. It was kind of endearing.</p><p>“I will remain like this for a while, it is most comfortable. Let us continue our earlier conversation.”</p><p>Angelica was a fast learner when she wanted to be, giving her a squeeze after hearing her sentence. Hartmut glanced at them for a moment before seemingly accepting her order, shifting to look at her in full again.</p><p>“I… I will not allow <em> any </em> of my people to meet the Supreme Couple, one after the other. Never again. You’re all <em> mine</em>, even if you don’t remember it! It is my duty to protect you, and it is my duty to decide your fates. Not even the Gods have the right to interfere!”</p><p>Hartmut looked at her in awe, his face showing his reinflamed zeal more clearly than ever before, but she did not care. It was her duty as their master.</p><p>“Let us talk in more depth about this topic at another time. Now that you serve me again, we need to decide how we will go about it. You cannot serve me openly.”</p><p>Hartmut grimaced as if being struck, before looking at the ground in resignation.</p><p>“I am aware that I can serve you better from the shadows, even if I do not like it.”</p><p>She nodded, deep in thought.</p><p>“Indeed, we will need to keep our meetings to a minimum. There are only so many times I can sneak out here before raising suspicion. There is also the matter of communication, I cannot send ordannanzes myself until I get my schtappe.”</p><p>“If I may make a suggestion, I believe magic letters would be more discrete. With the right materials, I should be able to brew you a few which you can send by simply supplying your glorious mana.”</p><p>The idea had merit, but it would still be suspicious if she suddenly started receiving letters. Her attendants and parents would surely wish to check them.</p><p>“Hmm, very well. Make sure to send your letters to Angelica. So long as you address it to make it look like letters from a tutor I hired for her, there should be no issues. I can send my letters to you from my hidden room. I’ll leave it to you to arrange a suitable cover story for yourself.”</p><p>“There is no need, Milady. My family is not close enough to watch my correspondence. If any attendants notice, I can simply let them know they are letters from my Goddess and they shall not pry further.”</p><p>Rozemyne sighed internally. She was pretty sure Hartmut’s idea of why they would not pry was quite far from the reality of what his attendants thought… Her head hurt from the thought that he might have left home today declaring that he was going to meet “his Goddess”… It was best to not even address it.</p><p>“We should meet no more than once or twice a season, and we may need to use other meeting points as well. Downtown and the commoners’ forest would likely be easier to sneak away to. This place will be fine for our next meeting, however, I expect there is a need for a long conversation with no chance of being interrupted.”</p><p>Hartmut lit up at her words, looking at her with sparkling eyes.</p><p>“Oh? Do you have a task for me, Milady?”</p><p>“Not so specific to call it a task. Simply your job as a scholar. From the rumours I have been hearing, and from the differences I have seen myself, this weave is already shaping up to be quite different from the last. I wish for information, especially on the neutral and Leisegang nobles, as I cannot easily interact with them in my position.”</p><p>“I will not fail you! I will collect as much information as I can by our next meeting! However… forgive this foolish servant for not yet understanding your will, but I wish to ask you another question. Do you plan to make changes in Ehrenfest before you leave to improve it for the retainers who remain?”</p><p>She closed her eyes for a second. That was another long conversation to have… </p><p>“We have wasted enough time that Dregarnuhr cannot spin back. We can worry about planning the future another time. Angelica.”</p><p>“Yes, Milady!”</p><p>She could feel the knight stiffen under her, ready to act despite currently serving as her seat and backrest.</p><p>“Let me down and prepare your armor. We need to have <em> something </em> to show from our gathering trip.”</p><p>“I will eagerly await Dregarnuhr to spin our threads together again, Milady.”</p><p>Hartmut knelt before she summoned Nyx ignoring his rant of her divinity. Hisui appeared again, jumping into Rozemyne’s lap as Angelica took her place at her back. Together, they flew away from the meeting point, going further into the forest.</p><p>They spent at least another hour hunting feybeast from the back of her highbeast – Angelica had surprisingly good tips for aerial combat to offer. Their spoils should serve to at least avoid any suspicion about their actions.</p><p>There was no need for her worry, as on her return back home no one batted an eye. Her father was even impressed by the amount and quality of materials they brought back. It was hard to hide her true emotions about successfully sneaking away from her family, and instead she simply donned her happy face and basked in his praise. Stealing a few hugs from her parents to end the day on a high note, she retired to her chambers with a satisfied heart.</p>

    <p>Rozemyne was sitting patiently in her chambers as her hair was pulled every which way, getting combed and styled by Tuuliane and Gretia. Despite wanting to have a different hair style this weave than the last, somehow they once again settled on something quite similar to her signature look from before – some small braids and a bun in the back, although instead of using the stick to hold it together, they went through the trouble of securing it with thread and pomade. Which was an ordeal.</p><p>“Bear it a bit longer, Milady. We must make sure your look is flawless. We wouldn’t want Lady Veronica to find any reason to be hostile to you.”</p><p>She sighed at her sister’s encouragement. But she was right. She remembered the look on her mother’s face when the invitation for the Veronican tea party arrived at the end of spring, with <em> both </em> of their names clearly written on the card. The invitation arrived a whole two weeks in advance, delivered by one of the castle’s servant girls. It was written on a high quality wooden board, decorated with seasonal flowers. She would have thought it pretty, except for the fact that it was very clearly singling her family out. She doubted any other pre-academy child would be in attendance.</p><p>Rozemyne was merely annoyed by the thought of attending as the youngest, but her mother was outright panicking at first. She had, after all, experienced years of bullying at the hands of the ladies in the faction at such tea parties, and was no doubt fearing the worst. Thankfully Mathilde expertly took her mother aside, and by the time they returned, Roselinde wore a determined look on her face.</p><p>Clothing orders followed in a hurry, along with “training” tea parties, aimed more at her attendants than herself, and gathering all they could to strengthen their position. Rozemyne did her own preparations too of course, although she kept that hidden from everyone but Angelica.</p><p>“We are finished with your hair. Please stand up and raise your arms.”</p><p>She was drawn back to the present by Lieseleta, who was holding the finest gown she owned. They dressed her in her undergarments before placing her in front of the mirror for <strike>torture</strike> hair styling, so now the only part left was her dress and shoes. Unfortunately for her, they shot down her idea of designing a dress to allow her to move like a knight and insisted she followed the current fashion. They wouldn’t even allow her to hide weapons under her dress! How annoying, and after she got through the trouble of acquiring some throwing blades as well. Eckhart had the right idea to carry at least a handful at all times. Speaking of knights…</p><p>Rozemyne glanced to the side, where Angelica was guarding the door, as she always did in such moments. Her airheaded knight was currently sulking after being told it would not be possible to guard her at the tea party. There was just no helping it – appearing with an escort knight would just be rude. She had no desire to provoke Veronica without any gain to show for it. All of this meant that Angelica would be the only one to be left behind, the rest following her as her attendants.</p><p>Her vision was blocked when Lieseleta and Gretia gently pulled her dress over her head, making her lose sight of her knight for a moment, and Tuuliane quickly got to work on the many small buttons and laces in the back. Rozemyne was a little sad that the tea party was not just a little bit later, somewhere in the summer instead of spring. It was so near they could already feel the effects of Leidenschaft slowly raising his spear, but Flutrane’s waters had not cleared away yet. So, dressing to the season, like a proper lady, her dress was a soft shade of green, with dark green embroidery along all the edges. The dress was of light cotton to account for the warming weather, which she appreciated, but the big petticoat with many layers, and the large sleeves starting from her elbows were still a nuisance. How she wished for the simpler dresses she developed shortly before reaching adulthood. They were more suitable for moving in. Dunkelfelger was happy to adopt them for their fashion immediately, but Ehrenfest…</p><p>After everything was done and her retainers gushed about her appearance as usual, she finally left her room to meet her mother in one of the tea rooms they had agreed upon.</p><p>“Mother, I have finished my preparations.”</p><p>Roselinde looked at her as she approached, a sparkle in her eyes. The smile on her face widened slightly as she inspected her.</p><p>“Oh, you just look so darling, Rozemyne! I worried green would not suit you, but clearly you look lovely in the colours of any season. It is as if the Gods all favor you!”</p><p>Yeah. If only those pesky Gods would <em> not </em> favour her. She would have a much easier life this way. Still, she was aware that her mother did only intend to praise her, so she sucked it up and smiled.</p><p>“Thank you, Mother. You look lovely yourself, a green dress combined with your shiny green hair makes you look like Flutrane herself.”</p><p>She was putting on the best smile she could manage and complimented her mother back, banishing the annoyed thoughts from her mind.</p><p>“Oh my, your father said just the same thing. You both flatter me too much.”</p><p>Rozemyne had to suppress a grin at that answer. Of course her dad would not fail to praise mom every chance he got. Well, both of them were not wrong either. Her mom looked stunning.</p><p>“Shall we set out soon, Mother? Since we are both ready to leave.”</p><p>“We are not quite ready, my dear. Are you not forgetting something?”</p><p>Roselinde smiled at her sweetly through the thin fabric covering her face, her hand moving to her cheek. The move caused the veil to flutter slightly, making it obvious what she was referring to.</p><p>“I’m not sure what you mean, Mother.”</p><p>She smiled back with her noble lady smile. She was <em> not </em> going to give in to her mother this time.</p><p>“Where is your veil, dear? Showing up without one would surely earn Lady Veronica’s ire. We don’t want that after all your hard work now, do we?”</p><p>Rozemyne would <em> not </em> wear one of those stupid things. There was no way she would give in. Nope.</p><p>Not much later, they were walking to their carriage, with both of their eyes shielded from the sun by veils. Rozemyne pouted, crossing her arms as she walked, making sure to wait for the moment when her mother looked at her to puff up her cheeks and blow air as hard as she could at the veil, making it flutter away from her face for a moment. </p><p>

</p><p>Sadly, it seemed to have the opposite effect from what she hoped for. Her mother looked back fondly, nearly cooing at her.</p><p>‘Damn that old Chaocipher and her Ahrensbach trends. We didn’t even wear these stupid things in the hot summer of <em> Dunkelfelger </em>, I can’t believe these idiots are wearing a veil in spring… If Lestilaut saw me like this, he would be rolling with laughter…’</p><p>At least she was only forced to wear that pesky veil on factional tea parties. She hoped.</p><p>The carriage ride was a boring, if stifling, affair. Her mother being all tense did nothing to improve Rozemyne’s mood. Just thinking about all that false platitude and maneuvering ahead of them was tiring enough already.</p><p>“Mother, could you please try to at least look relaxed? They will not dare to openly speak out against you anymore. Lady Veronica will not tolerate bullying the family of her newest pawn, for better or for worse. My current standing as Lord Wilfried’s head knight will make sure of that.”</p><p>Roselinde sighed, her shoulders dropping minutely as she looked outside the window.</p><p>“Am I that transparent?”</p><p>“...Only for me, Mother. I do not want to appear conceited, but I am <em> very </em> adept at reading people. Your previous mask would blind most, but not Lady Veronica, or her inner circle. So please relax a bit. It will be me that Lady Veronica will be most focused on anyway.”</p><p>Her mothers shoulders tensed up again, good grief.</p><p>“And how can I relax knowing exactly that? I am your Wiegenmilch. It is my duty to protect you from those–”</p><p>“You can’t.”</p><p>Roselinde looked at her in shock, her eyes widening. It seemed all those years of harassment weighed more heavily on her mother than she had anticipated.</p><p>“I do not want to belittle your efforts, Mother, but this whole tea party is most likely just so Lady Veronica can parade me around. She has no interest in you. At best you are just an accessory to my worth in fixing her dear grandson. You cannot shield me from scrutiny – I am the main attraction. This is as much a statement as it is a test.”</p><p>Rozemyne loosened her control of her expression for a moment to grin at her mother.</p><p>“They are expecting a helpless little girl, being infatuated with Angriff instead of Grammaratur. They know nothing.”</p><p>She had dealt with worse for more than a decade. Some petty ladies who thought themself of any relevance were no worry for her. Rozemyne had dealt with the pitfall politics of greater duchies. This was child's play in comparison. Should any of them overstep too much, they would have a tragic accident in the near future. There was little place for mercy; she learned that the hard way. A bloody example worked wonders to curbstomp any form of resistance inside the nobility. Fear was as good a tool as any, maybe even one of the best.</p><p>Not that Rozemyne would tell <em> that </em> to her mother.</p><p>“…I can only pray that you are wrong. I would actually prefer the previous bullying. But thank you for trying to reassure me.”</p><p>At least her little speech seemed to have somewhat worked. The anxious face of her mom made place for “Lady Roselinde,” a member of a branch family of the archducal clan of Ehrenfest, First Wife of Guthfried, head of house Thorwaechter. That was much better. </p><p>They arrived at the castle without any more conversation between them, so she put her best ladies smile on. It was showtime.</p><p>The tea room they were led to was as garish as she expected. From her memories of seeing Ahrensbach at the Interduchy Tournament and Archduke Conferences, Veronica’s tea party room looked like someone half-paid attention to the duchy’s trends from the past decade, and tastelessly threw together the most showy items for every single one of them. The room’s only potential saving feature – a row of windows overlooking the gardens – was covered in layers upon layers of thin violet and pink fabric until barely any light could trickle in through them, painting everything else in a pink hue. Ornately decorated paintings of the sea took up every bit of free wall space, which would have been a nice touch if not for the clashing styles and blatant show of wealth. Even the furniture was out of place.</p><p>Ehrenfest’s old tradition, from its many forests and specialised carpenters, was ornately carved furniture from gorgeously deep-coloured wood, with a few special pieces even made from trombe wood to show the highest status in the duchy. The Thorwaechter mansion had most of its furniture made in this fashion, and it was even commonly seen in the offices of the castle. Here, however, in Veronica’s domain, furniture was made of bleached wood with decorative patterns painted in bright colours of pink and orange. It was an attack on the senses.</p><p>“My, Lady Veronica, this room is simply breathtaking! I have seen nothing like it before. Your taste is truly one of a kind!”</p><p>As per protocol, they had to greet the host first. Rozemyne couldn’t help herself but comment on this offense to the eyes that the tea party room was as soon as the greetings were finished. She of course put as much fake enthusiasm into her voice as she could muster to sound like the impressed child Veronica would have been expecting. From the corner of her eye, she saw her mother’s smile twitch.</p><p>“I see you have a good eye for fashion, Rozemyne. This room has been decorated according to Ahrensbach trends. A simple duchy like Ehrenfest with its plain trends just cannot compare to a greater duchy. It pains me that the tea rooms of even the ladies in my faction are so dull and colorless, but alas, Ahrensbach would only give such treasures to those in the highest seat.”</p><p>If Veronica hoped to impress or discourage her by flaunting her wealth and privilege, it was just an useless endeavour. As if Rozemyne had even the desire for anything presented here. Of course, none of her inner thoughts showed on her face as she continued to play the impressed little girl.</p><p>“How gracious of you to allow us to experience it here.”</p><p>Veronica patted her head at her sweet reply, which made her feel sick, but she just continued smiling until the woman finally took her crinkly old hand off of her.</p><p>“Roselinde, I am so pleased you could make it to my tea party this time. It has been a shame that Heilschmerz held you back from so many in the past. Your family is so eager to speak with you again I made sure to seat you next to them. You may leave now so Dregarnuhr can spin your thread slowly with theirs.”</p><p>“I am ever so grateful for your concern, Lady Veronica. Come now, Rozemyne, let us greet the rest of the family.”</p><p>She was about to follow her mother when her instincts screamed at her to dodge. She barely managed to suppress her reaction when Veronica’s paw landed on her shoulder this time.</p><p>“Worry not, Roselinde. Little Rozemyne can greet her family as we make our way around the room. She will have the privilege of sitting beside me today since it is her first faction tea party. You want to leave a good first impression on everyone as my grandson’s future …knight… don’t you, Rozemyne?”</p><p>Veronica smiled at her from the side, but the way she paused around the word “knight” made it obvious to Rozemyne that she was referring to their first conversation, when Veronica offered to make her Wilfried’s second or third wife. It also confirmed her earlier theory that she would be paraded around to show how Veronica will stay influential in the future of the archducal family.</p><p>She quickly responded to Veronica’s question, and once the woman’s gaze was off her face, she gave her mother a brief reassuring smile. Roselinde had no choice but to bow her head in acknowledgement and excuse herself, leaving her daughter behind.</p><p>Veronica kept her by her side as the last of the guests arrived, which made for an awkward experience of exchanging greetings, since the couple guests who arrived after her were archnobles as well. After they knelt and greeted Veronica, Rozemyne had to kneel and greet them as the younger one with similar status. Luckily, being a member of a branch family meant that even among the archnobles, some of them had to greet her first. Normally, protocol would have dictated that she goes around the room and exchanges greetings with those already present before the tea party started, but as she was subject to Veronica’s whims, she was seated by the table to the woman’s right at the head of the oval-shaped table as soon as all guests arrived.</p><p>Veronica looked over the gathered ladies who were quietly exchanging pleasantries, before rising to address the room. She put on her most charming smile, and for the first time, Rozemyne could clearly see the resemblance between her and Detlinde from her memories. If it wasn’t for her toxic nature poisoning her old face, she would have looked like quite the charismatic woman.</p><p>“What a wonderful sight to see so many of the ladies of my faction gathered here. With my dear grandson’s debut, our faction grows even stronger. The future of Ehrenfest is bright as we follow in the footsteps of the great Ahrensbach. The recipe of sweets I have for you today was gifted to me personally, to celebrate Wilfried’s baptism by my connections in Ahrensbach, and I have graciously prepared to share this treat with you all. Let us enjoy some tea now.”</p><p>On cue, the attendants stepped forward to place plates of <a href="https://eatlikeasultan.com/medieval-andalusian-walnut-confection/" rel="nofollow">brownish looking squares</a> on the table, and pour tea for all of the ladies. As customary, Veronica picked up a piece of the snack first and popped it into her mouth, but Rozemyne had a feeling that rather than doing this for poison testing, she simply felt it appropriate for her to try the delicacy before anyone else.</p><p>Looking at the snack more closely, she noticed the glistening grains of sugar it was completely covered in, but underneath, whatever food it was, had a somewhat unappetizing brown color with small specks of red and other shades of brown mixed through it. The ladies seemed apprehensive, but Rozemyne was curious. She did not remember seeing this in the past weave. Could it be that a new recipe was invented or passed along to traders because of how different this weave was? Or has she simply missed it? She reached for one to try it herself.</p><p>The taste was… unexpected. The sweet itself appeared to be some kind of solidified walnut paste covered in sugar to give it some sweetness, but there was a bite to it too. Maybe something like chilli or a mixture of ground spices was dispersed in the paste, warming up the inside of her mouth as she ate the treat in two bites. The texture still had some creaminess to it, and the combination of sweet and spicy mixed quite nicely on her tongue. She was concerned that it would be overwhelmingly spicy, based on the stories she heard in the last weave and the few complaints from her mother, but she found it to be quite pleasant. She took a small sip of her tea, which was a touch too sweet for her – probably to show off with plentiful use of sugar – but the flavour itself blended nicely with the spiciness it spread further around in her mouth.</p><p>As she took another one of the treats, she glanced around the room. She appeared to be the only one enjoying the treat aside from Veronica. Of course, there was no outright denouncing of its flavor – nobody was that bold – but she could see the hesitance in their movements while eating, and their faces getting redder as they tried to settle their mouths with sips of tea, only for it to make it worse.</p><p>“I see that it is quite to your liking, young Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Indeed, Lady Veronica. It was a surprise to taste spices in such a sweet treat, but after allowing the flavours to blend in my mouth, it became truly delicious. The earthy flavours combined with the fiery heat are like Leidenschaft protecting Geduldh to bring back harmony to the world. That your chefs succeeded in portraying the deep bond of the Gods is truly a marvel. As expected from your eye for talent, to pick up on their innate potential and refine it to this decree. You are truly blessed by Sehweit and Cuococalura.”</p><p>Veronica seemed pleased by her extensive praise. Though, the linking of Cuococalura and Veronica was blasphemy at best. The God of Cooking had most likely not the best impression of Veronica’s liberate usage of poison. Still, Rozemyne was not so petty as to not acknowledge that this sweet treat <em> was </em> pretty good. Even if the level of spice would need to be adjusted for the average lady from Ehrenfest to be able to enjoy it just as she had. It may be more popular among the men too, which was currently an entirely untapped market.</p><p>“May I inquire if the recipe is for sale, Lady Veronica? I am intrigued if my own chefs can replicate this marvelous composition.”</p><p>“It is using some of the more recent ingredients bought from Ahrensbach. I would normally insist on holding onto it for a bit longer, but I am willing to send a retainer to contact your household after our gathering. It is always a delight to see someone truly appreciating the delights of Cuococalura, enabled by my direct link to our patron duchy.”</p><p>“I am humbled by your grace in giving me early access, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>Veronica nodded as both of them took a couple more sweets on their plates. Should Rozemyne be concerned that she shared a similar taste with the woman? She finished one piece of the walnut square and took a sip of her tea, using the opportunity to look around over the rim of her tea cup. A subtle glance told Rozemyne everything she needed to know. This blatant show of Veronica’s favor towards her had intimidated nearly all of the other guests who heard their exchange. She had to suppress a smirk as Gertrude – Gretia’s former “mother” – looked openly distressed, even if Roselinde’s smile was strained as well.</p><p>Once Veronica’s plate was clear once again, she subtly signaled for an attendant to pull her chair back to allow her to stand and walk around the room. This was a common occurrence at tea parties that were too large for the host to be able to converse with everyone from her seat. However, unlike her memories of a normal tea party, Veronica beckoned her over and signaled Rozemyne should follow her lead, which she obeyed without showing her reluctance.</p><p>Together, they started making their way around the room, stopping near every person. As soon as Veronica stopped somewhere, a servant hurriedly pulled a chair behind her so that if she wanted to, Veronica could walk, stop and sit immediately without having to bother checking if there was a seat behind her. She was at least more graceful than that, however not so graceful to also request a seat for Rozemyne.</p><p>She should have taken it as an insult, being made to follow Veronica around and stand by her as she conversed, but she simply decided to treat the whole affair similar to guarding Wilfried. Treating Veronica as if she was the charge she had to protect as a knight. The pleased glimmer in Veronica’s eyes told her that she had just passed a hidden test of sorts, after which she began involving Rozemyne in her conversations too. It was almost like merely being allowed to participate in the tea party as an invited lady, and not as a guard knight, was her reward for her behaviour. Although, it was not at all surprising that Veronica treated Rozemyne more as her own retainer than that of her grandson. Nearly his whole retinue was namesworn to her after all.</p><p>The first person to visibly react to her presence by Veronica was Gertrude who seemed to be subconsciously leaning away from her during the very brief time Veronica stopped near her. As a mednoble, there was not much conversation between her and the head of the faction, it was simply her opportunity to thank Veronica for her invitation and praise the snack they were graced with, which Veronica took with a kind smile. Just as Gertrude looked relieved that Veronica was moving on from her quickly, Rozemyne couldn’t help but widen her smile at her for just the briefest moment, which made the mednoble woman pale to the colour of plant paper. The childish satisfaction Rozemyne felt from the reaction made it almost worth being paraded around by Veronica. Almost.</p><p>The order of meetings did not seem to follow any obvious rank as some med- and even laynobles were conversed with before even speaking with some of the present archnobles. Maybe it was sorted by favor? But even that seemed unlikely as well. Maybe it was just Veronica’s fancy?</p><p>The next meeting of note was when they arrived at where her mother was sitting with the rest of her family. Rozemyne’s eye was immediately drawn to the most commanding presence in the small group - an older lady similar in age to Veronica, with graying hair and sharp eyes moving from Veronica to Rozemyne as soon as it was socially acceptable to do so. Rozemyne made eye-contact with her confidently, noting the close resemblance to her mother’s jade-colored eyes. Most likely that was her grandmother in this weave.</p><p>After addressing Veronica and a small bout of meaningless small talk, it was Rozemyne who was addressed next.</p><p>“I am so pleased to finally have the opportunity to meet you, my dear Rozemyne. I am Gerlinde, your grandmother.”</p><p>She already expected as much but still bowed her head as was proper. Giving a simplified greeting, much to the apparent approval of the elderly woman.</p><p>“It is such a shame that we had no real chance to meet for a tea party between family, my dear granddaughter. But I realize your thread has been pulled in many directions since your baptism this summer. I am quite eager to hear about how you are faring in the winter playroom. Oh, but I wish not to hold up Lady Veronica with my chatter, perhaps we shall arrange a tea party in the near future. There is so much to talk about, after all.”</p><p>Rozemyne gave the woman her best lady smile before replying. She remembered Veronica’s attempt to use her relation to Oswald at their first meeting, and the fact she did not interfere so far only strengthened her suspicion that the old Chaocipher was supportive of this move. How annoying.</p><p>“It is truly regrettable that Dregaruhr has been spinning our threads through such different patterns. It would be a delight to have the opportunity to leisurely share the blessings of Grammaratur with my mother’s Wiegenmilch.”</p><p>She indicated to Mathilde, who was following her at a respectful distance.</p><p>“May my head attendant converse with your own, for such a date?”</p><p>“It is a relief to see that Dauerleben and Heilschmerz continue to favor you, Mathilde. You may confer with Yuliane for a date.”</p><p>That seemed to satisfy both her grandmother and Veronica, who shepherded her on as soon as the promise for arrangements was made. Mathilde nodded in acknowledgement after making eye contact with the mentioned attendant, and followed Rozemyne through the room.</p><p>Rozemyne tried to not dwell on the matter much since she still had the room full of prying eyes to fool. She just hoped that was the only invitation she would receive that day. She should have just shut up about this topic when she received <em> two </em> additional requests for a tea party from Lady Royella – Matthias' mother – and Lady Wilhelmina, the mother of Laurenz, respectively.</p><p>She nearly blinked at the sudden invitations. What did both of those women want with her? Mathilde truly had her hands full, juggling her schedule with all those sudden invitations. At least, to Rozemyne’s slight relief, those two women were the last to really interact with her, and soon after she could finally return to her seat following Veronica. The old trombe seemed satisfied with the display of her new pawn and signaled to change the tea once she was settled. As if waiting for the same signal, the ladies all around began to trade the newest gossip, none of which caught Rozemyne’s interest, so she simply relaxed as she took a leisurely sip of her fresh tea. She had no real interest in the ridiculous slander heaped upon Leisegang, or the newest trend coming from the Sovereignty. She only listened with half an ear until Brigitte's name was suddenly dropped, drawing her full attention.</p><p>“…truly? Despite the lovely courtship stone Lord Hassheit gave her? To think Lady Brigitte would stain her reputation like that…”</p><p>‘Oh? So Brigitte postponed binding her star to her supposed suitor. Or maybe it was just the prelude to her cancelling it? I faintly remember that she had some trouble in that regard, leading her to be employed in my service in the first place.’</p><p>“He must look upon her like Ewigeliebe at Geduldh if he is willing to accept such an offence.”</p><p>“Was it truly her who postponed the starbinding? Maybe Lord Hassheit is simply being cautious. With how much time his supposed future Goddess of Light is spending with the commoners, he wouldn’t want to be bound to Efflorelume pretending to be Geduldh.”</p><p>Several ladies gasped at the suggestion, but the absurd rumour was making Rozemyne quickly lose interest.</p><p>“Oh my. Even those Leisegang think that Giebe Illgner and his ilk act more like the commoners they like so much than proper nobles, but to think a Giebe’s sister would become a trampled flower…”</p><p>Another lady covered her mouth with wide eyes, but someone else shook her head and continued with her own theory.</p><p>“Ordoschnelli sang a different melody to me. I hear that Illgner is so close to their commoners not out of kindness, but out of need for fighters.”</p><p>“Commoner fighters? What could they do with no blessing from Leidenschaft?”</p><p>“They sneak into the homes of nobles under Verbergen’s shroud when the God of Darkness rules the sky to spy and carry poison.”</p><p>“Such a lowly province to dare to target other nobles! To think they would use commoners to make such daring moves.”</p><p>As the ladies were getting carried away with the wild theory that Illgner was using commoners to attack or poison other nobles, Rozemyne was reminded of the last meeting with Hartmut just two days ago. She closed her eyes for a moment to recall the memory.</p><p>Her loyal fanatic was elated to bring her a fountain of information.</p><p>“… another tidbit I heard about is the frankly ridiculous rumors swirling about Illgner right now, specifically the family of their Giebe, Lord Helfried. I remember that Lady Brigitte was once in your service as your knight, and you seemed to favor them in your earlier Industries. Do you desire to get involved, my Lady?”</p><p>Rozemyne looked up from the board she was taking notes on - the fact that she had no scholar aside from Hartmut was a bit inconvenient, so she was forced to take notes herself. Not that she really minded that much. In a sense, it was a comforting reminder of her time making books so long ago.</p><p>“I thought Brigitte would bind her star to someone called Hassheit this coming summer. Lieseleta informed me that they already exchanged engagement stones. I had no intention to get involved with Illgner, seeing that their troubles were not that relevant. They still <em> do </em> have their complete noble population, or am I mistaken?”</p><p>Hartmut in turn nodded his head, but his eyes told her that he was unsure about something.</p><p>“They do, my Lady. But from what I gathered, the initial rumors were only the beginning. In fact, they are multiplying at an unusual rate instead of fading into the background as would be expected. I have been told that they are a constant in ladies’ society among Leisegang already. To me it seems someone is spreading those rumors, while escalating the situation in a bit clumsy, but controlled, manner.”</p><p>“So, someone is trying to hurt the reputation of Helfried’s family? What about Brigitte?”</p><p>Rozemyne did not like what she was hearing.</p><p>“It does seem that way, my Lady. I cannot prove anything at this moment, but I suspect it is likely that the culprit is none other than Lord Hassheit, or his family. The fact that Lady Brigitte postponed their starbinding for a year, without giving a very convincing reason, only further points in this direction. I tried to subtly dig a little deeper into this case, but refrained from any overt measures until you give me the order.”</p><p>Rozemyne wracked her brain. She could swear she heard the name Hassheit in the past weave somewhere as well. And Brigitte did marry Viktor later, so maybe that Hassheit guy was her failed engagement that led to her trouble in the past? What changed, though? Ugh, the butterfly effect was annoying to deal with.</p><p>“I want you to dig deeper into this whole Illgner business, Hartmut. But do not expose yourself unnecessarily. I do want to enable a good life for Brigitte, but it is not worth revealing our hand for it right now. Also, I am slightly curious who told you about all of these rumors among Leisegang. Please tell me you are not crossdressing again…”</p><p>Hartmut gave her a brilliant smile in return. She did not like it at all.</p><p>“That was not necessary, my Lady. It was none other than Brunhilde who told me all of this. Apparently, Groschel is concerned that those rumors are being directed mainly in the direction of the Veronica faction. Should it truly be the machinations of Hassheit and his family, it is obvious that Illgner will forsake its neutral status and join them, tipping the balance more in Lady Veronica’s favor. I heard that Lady Elvira tried to meet with Lord Helfried as well, but stopped for some reason. There was no crossdressing necessary for now.”</p><p>“…You did not need to pick up on this embarrassing practice when Justus met the Supreme Couple, you know?”</p><p>“But it is such an effective tool, my Lady! Worry not, however, I will not allow anything to fall back on you. I am known to be eccentric already, so there will be no problem.”</p><p>Rozemyne suppressed the grimace she wanted to make. Well, at least he was not doing it right now… She needed a distraction.</p><p>“So… Brunhilde. How is she doing right now?”</p><p>“She is well, as far as I know at least. She spends most of her socializing time with Leonore, aside from her own family. Do you intend to acquire their loyalty again?”</p><p>She shook her head. There was no need for it. She would miss them, sure. But since she was an archnoble and a member of the Veronica faction, it was impossible for them to serve her anyway.</p><p>“There is no need for it. They may be even better off without my interference. So far the only members of my old retinue I intend to acquire are those whose fate requires my intervention. As long as they are happy, I do not care.”</p><p>“It is as you say, my Lady. But if you truly desire their services, I am sure that I can arrange for some circumstances that will leave them no chance but to–”</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>Hartmut was quick to kneel after she raised her voice, bowing his head as he began to apologize. She waved him off.</p><p>“Just forget about it. I want them to be happy, or at least satisfied with their life, not to force my will upon them for no reason. You will leave them alone in this regard.”</p><p>“As you command, my Goddess!”</p><p>Rozemyne was taken out of her reminiscence of the past, returning to the present as one of those ladies spoke to Veronica with a most ridiculous suggestion.</p><p>“What do you think about all of this, Lady Veronica? Should we not purge those fitly commoners for daring to oppose us? Or even censure Giebe Illgner for that matter. They are directly opposing your will for a peaceful Ehrenfest under your son’s rule with their shameful antics!”</p><p>Veronica for her part seemed unbothered by the suggestion, merely taking a sip of her tea before raising her eyebrow slightly. </p><p>“Those in the heavens do not move at the slightest misschief of Ordoschnelli.” </p><p>Instead of being discouraged by the rebuke as Rozemyne would have expected, even more ladies chimed into the discussion. Suggesting all levels of purges or disciplinary measures for Illgner. Rozemyne could not help herself but openly scoff at those ridiculous notions, earning her the attention of everyone.</p><p>

</p><p>“You believe some stray Ordoschnelli about their <em> closeness </em> to commoners? And bother Lady Veronica with it as well? As far as I was informed, they were <em> always </em> close to them. It is what you would expect of such a rural province, not under the grace of our faction. If you are truly this concerned, send some scholars to gather information first. Jumping to conclusions and acting without understanding the situation is below any noble, regardless of their standing. Illgner and the worthiness of their Giebe family can still be made to prove their fitness to be called true nobles should those <em> rumors </em> turn out to be true.”</p><p>Veronica looked at her from the side, a hint of approval in her eyes.</p><p>“How bold of you, young Rozemyne. So you think it is not worth our time to listen to those rumors? What about the possibility of their commoners betraying us?”</p><p>Rozemyne shrugged slightly, looking at Veronica with a perfectly crafted smile.</p><p>“With all due respect, Lady Veronica. What could they even do? Who among us would be so foolish as to let some lowly commoners, and from a rural province no less, into our homes? Who among us is so foolish that they would fall at the hands of a commoner’s attack? I doubt that even a mob of them could beat a single trained knight on his worst day. But if their loyalty to our archducal family is questionable, they can just be tested.”</p><p>Rozemyne felt slightly bad for speaking like that about commoners, but it was the way of the nobility to underestimate them constantly. She gave an elegant flourish with her hand, as if waving the issue away without much thought.</p><p>“But if I may speak honestly, I do not see the point. There is nothing to gain for us except lowering the taxes Illgner provides. There is also the issue of payment or time investment for those hired to inquire about their loyalty. Investing resources for purging those commoners is simply not worth it. All of this just because of some mischief from Ordoschnelli?”</p><p>The room had become quiet as she spoke, everyone looking at her, but Rozemyne was more focused on Veronica’s expression as the woman leaned back slightly in her seat, taking another sip of tea before speaking again.</p><p>“And if those rumors turn out to be true? What if they plan to rebel under Giebe Illgner’s orders?”</p><p>“Then he and his family, as well as his supporters, will be brought to justice by either the Knight’s Order or those residing in the heavens.”</p><p>Rozemyne made sure to look Veronica into the eyes as she said that specific part, making the old Chaocipher smile minutely. Gods, having to butter up the woman was tiring.</p><p>“Their medals are stored in the castle for a reason. There is no place in any duchy for traitors. Being barred from the privilege of ascending the towering stairwell is a fitting punishment.”</p><p>A sudden idea popped into her head, nearly making her smile.</p><p>“On the other hand… If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, Lady Veronica?”</p><p>“Oh? Please do, Rozemyne. It is always a delight to hear the thoughts of those growing under the heavenly cloak.”</p><p>Out of the corner of her eyes Rozemyne saw the widening of eyes this blatant statement of favor evoked.</p><p>“Maybe this opportunity is a most fitting trial of Glucklitat for Lord Wilfried? I am sure that he will be blessed by Anwachs as he attempts his future duties as an Aub for the first time. Should those stray Ordoschnelli turn out to be just that, there is no harm done, and I am sure my lord will be delighted to see some of the lands soon under his rule. And should there truly be some mischief of Chaocipher involved, it would be an ample opportunity to show his blessings to Aub Ehrenfest by solving the issue with aplomb.”</p><p>“You would risk my grandson by exposing him to potential traitors?”</p><p>Veronica’s face stayed carefully neutral, but Rozemyne was not deterred at all.</p><p>“What risk are you speaking of, Lady Veronica? Of course, he would not inquire about every minute detail himself, that is the duty of his pillars. My lord would fulfill his rightful role in directing our efforts, as those in the heavens should. And on the occasion that he would travel to the province himself, he would have his full retinue present, including us guard knights. As his Leidenschaft, it would of course be my utmost duty to protect him at all costs. Should there truly be agents of Chaocipher at work, they would simply taste the edge of my manablade.”</p><p>Veronica took another sip of her tea before her face regained her polite smile again. Rozemyne used the opportunity to take another sip as well.</p><p>“I will think about your suggestion, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Of course, I thank you for allowing me to try my hand at being Anhaltung. I still have much to learn, but do hope it was useful to you non the less.”</p><p>She bowed her head. As Veronica seemed to move on, the conversation resumed as well, although the atmosphere was not as light as before. Rozemyne’s senses were honed well enough to be aware of the glances thrown in her direction at every change in topic, as if the ladies were now expecting her to judge their conversations at any minute. But the mundane topics of Ehrenfest politics, romance and fashion could not catch her attention. Her eye caught her mother’s as she scanned the room, and was immediately hit with guilt as she realised how much her mother must have been scared at her outburst. She decided to stay quiet for the rest of the tea party and simply observe until they were finally permitted to leave. The carriage ride home felt twice as long as the way to the tea party as her mother lectured her from the minute the carriage door closed until the moment they arrived back home.</p>

    <p>“Please make sure you stop to have your lunch and answer when we call you for dinner, Milady.”</p><p>The door to the hidden room finally closed behind Rozemyne after Gretia placed a small tray of tea and food on a table and left. Rozemyne let out a sigh. Convincing her family and retainers to let her spend the entire day brewing in her hidden room unsupervised was not an easy feat, despite both her mother and father being busy with noble business. They finally agreed after she insisted that it would be a good practice for the Academy, and the stockpile of ingredients was growing steadily too. She would simply spend the day reading otherwise. The next struggle was securing uninterrupted time from morning to dinner, since having to emerge for lunch would make what she had planned quite difficult to accomplish. Thankfully, they understood that it was not so easy to interrupt brewing after just a couple hours.</p><p>So, finally, for the first time in a long while, Rozemyne was alone for the entire day until dinner.</p><p>She did not hesitate to get to work, setting up the teleportation circle in the back of the hidden room. She previously considered having one permanently installed there, like the few she had scattered around the lower city and commoner forest, but considering her mother’s keen eye, she did not want to risk it being discovered. </p><p>Soft purring caught her attention, and Hisui crawled out from under the table, bumping her head against the hand Rozemyne just lifted away from drawing her circle.</p><p>“You really want to come with me, don’t you? How sneaky you are.”</p><p>She smiled as she scratched the head of her little furry friend. That morning, before the food was prepared for Rozemyne, Angelica insisted that as her guard knight, she should check the hidden room and make sure there was nothing in there that would endanger her charge while she brewed unprotected. It was clear Angelica simply wanted to have a task, since she would be unable to do her job for the rest of the day, so Rozemyne humoured the girl and let her investigate the hidden room. Angelica, of course, found nothing that wasn’t supposed to be there – how could she, when only Rozemyne and her parents could open the door? But just as the door was closing behind her dejected guard knight, Hisui snuck into the hidden room through the smallest gap. Rozemyne was quite sure she was the only one who noticed.</p><p>She took a quick look at the food sitting on the tray where Gretia left it. It was two palm-sized slices of fish with some steamed vegetables, moderately spiced which actually suited her taste. It was served on a plate with a magic circle that kept the food warm. Her original plan was to take the food with her and get rid of it in some way before returning, but it would be a shame to waste some perfectly good fish… So she scarfed it down quickly, before gathering Hisui up in her arms, stepping on the teleportation circle, and activating it.</p><hr /><p>In the rich part of the lower city of Ehrenfest, foot traffic was generally light. Once the stores opened for the morning, back alleys, used only by those working in the stores, were practically completely deserted. No customer would willingly walk anywhere but the main streets and risk being seen where those of lower status walked to work. This made the roof of a small building, bordering the alley near the Gilberta Company store, an ideal location for Rozemyne to appear out of thin air. She placed the circle there back when she was still in the temple, in case she ended up needing to rely on Benno again like in the past weave.</p><p>After checking her surroundings, she quietly murmured a prayer to Verbergen, and her presence along with Hisui’s completely vanished. It was so convenient to have her own ring now, she could maintain the spell for as long as she needed with no issue or worry it would break apart. She confidently made her way to the front of the store and stepped inside. She was happy to be hidden from everyone’s eyes, so she could actually take a moment to smile at the familiar sight. She and Lutz spent so much time walking through this part of the store, working on books, rinsham and so much more…</p><p>Lutz was of course nowhere to be seen now, but she grinned at the sight of Benno and Mark exchanging words out of the way of the customers. She briefly considered removing Verbergen’s protection and approaching them as if she just entered the shop, however, she unfortunately arrived at quite a busy time. Despite wearing brewing robes, and having her hair in simple braids to keep it out of her face, she was still recognisably dressed as a noble. That was the whole reason this was her first stop after all… And if anyone in this store recognised who she was and saw her in clothes not appropriate for an outing, her mother’s lecture would last until next summer at least.</p><p>So, she decided not to cause a fuss for Benno, and instead carefully made her way through the crowd of customers and employees to the back. She easily slipped past the apprentices, and when no one was looking, entered Benno’s office and softly closed the door behind her.</p><p>Hisui hopped off her shoulder and curiously walked around the room, sniffing the furniture and other items she found. Rozemyne also looked around in the familiar office, before making herself comfortable in the nicest looking chair she found. The fact that it was already facing the door was quite convenient.</p><p>Enhancing her hearing, she picked up on Benno and Mark finishing their conversation, and familiar footsteps coming closer and closer. Satisfied, she recalled Hisui, and cancelled the spell that kept them hidden from the world. Hisui jumped into her lap, and she reflexively started petting the feline. For a brief moment, the thought flashed in her mind that she should have invented swivel chairs, just for the dramatic effect of turning around as Benno entered. The notion was ridiculous, of course, so she quickly shook her head to get rid of it, but she couldn’t help but smirk slightly at the idea.</p><p>At that same moment, the door to the office opened.</p><p>The following events happened in such quick succession that anyone but a trained knight would have been left dumbfounded. Benno’s eye’s landed on the smirking Rozemyne. A short scream escaped his lips. He covered his mouth with his hand as his eyes grew large. There was a commotion in the background, and the door was slammed shut.</p><p>‘Well… That’s new…’</p><p>Rozemyne listened to the voices on the other side of the door for a moment, after which a sweating Benno opened the door again and quickly closed it behind him. In that time Rozemyne also managed to school her expression, and her usual noble smile was back on her face.</p><p>“Dregarnuhr has spun our threads quite far for some time now, Benno.”</p><p>She simply meant to say long time no see, but Benno seemed to take it as a rebuke and paled even further. He quickly dropped to one knee and crossed his arms over his chest in greeting.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, it is an honor. May this meeting, ordained by the divine guidance of the Gods, be blessed by the God of Fire Leidenschaft on this vibrant summer day.”</p><p>She simply waved him off. There was no need for such formalities when she just snuck into downtown and had a request for him. She remembered how much noble formalities stressed him out in the last weave; the least she could do now is try to go a bit easy on him. Well, as much as she could as an archnoble.</p><p>“Enough of that, sit. I have a request for you, Benno. It won’t be long.”</p><p>He scrambled to his feet and took a seat across from her. He did not look well. She had an odd feeling she had seen him looking so pale and shaky before, but she could not recall the time anymore. Her days as a commoner were already so far behind her.</p><p>“What can my humble company do for you, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“It is a simple task, really. I wish to have commoner clothes I can wear to explore downtown uninterrupted today. They need not fit me perfectly. Can you do that, Benno?”</p><p>“T-today, my Lady?”</p><p>She simply nodded, looking at Benno expectantly. She was not asking for a custom dress, after all, just something they already had in store. Corinna could definitely pull pieces together that would fit her well enough, so she felt no need to repeat herself or apologise to Benno. They had completed far more unreasonable tasks before.</p><p>Eventually, Benno excused himself with her permission, and quickly returned with a shaky Corinna, as she expected. Corinna was a lot more nervous around her than she remembered her being when she was an archduke candidate last time or when she was in the temple in this weave, however she still took her measurements again and noted down her growth. Half a bell later, Corinna returned to her work, and Rozemyne was dressed in low quality cotton of various shades of blue. The sleeves of her “new” dress were small and simple, the dress was still decorated with some ruffles, albeit sparingly, however it had practically no embroidery. It was the perfect dress for a rich commoner disguise, she was quite satisfied.</p><p>“You have done well, Benno. Dregarnuhr has spun our threads together with exceptional speed, but mine is now needed elsewhere. Ordoschnelli shall bring you news when I next require your services.”</p><p>Benno knelt with arms crossed and head lowered as she stood to leave. She quickly reached for the bag she brought with her from home which already held the clothes she came in, and she pulled out a small glass bottle. Without attendants, she could not be seen <em> handing money </em> to a commoner merchant. Even handing this bottle to him directly was out of the question. So she simply placed it on Benno’s desk and walked out without saying a word to him. He would soon discover the high quality rinsham in the expensive bottle she left for him as payment. She even brewed it herself with the tiniest bit of mana to evoke the blessing of Efflorelume, which also ensured that it was a recipe he could not simply recreate himself. </p><p>Rozemyne learned her lesson in the past. She knew better than to hand such a valuable recipe over as a gift of thanks, but as long as all Benno and Corinna had was a small bottle to use for themselves, she figured the value should be enough to cover the cost of the dress and the demand that it be prepared for her immediately. And so she walked out of the office with happy, confident steps.</p><hr /><p>The air, even in the richer part of downtown, was <em> something else</em>. She felt a sort of nostalgia creeping up inside of her, except she could not bring herself to feel anything other than disgust at the stench. How she lived here once in her past life, she could barely imagine anymore. But, she was out in the “fresh” air, free of the constant supervision that was getting a little bit suffocating.</p><p>She absent-mindedly began walking towards the central plaza, occasionally petting Hisui on her shoulders. After having to be so careful with how she moved, making sure she would not reveal her plans and her past to those around her, she was suddenly struggling with picking what to do next. There were so many options. Part of her wanted to simply explore the areas of downtown she did not see in her past life, part of her wanted to commission just a few of her inventions from the last weave that she was sorely missing. A little voice in the back of her mind also wanted to see how her other acquaintances were doing, but at the same time, she was nervous to find the answer.</p><p>A presence approaching her at speed caught her attention, it was not a mana signature, but her instincts were telling her to move, quickly, and avoid the collision that would be inevitable for anyone else. She took half a step back and to the left without even thinking about it, only to see a figure blur in front of her.</p><p>The trajectory was off. Clearly, the person also realised their mistake, and whatever they did in an attempt to not run into her was now making them stumble to the ground at the same rapid speed.</p><p>The figure was small, probably a child not much past baptism age. Not wanting to see a kid get hurt, she quickly reached to grab an arm. She readied her enhancement magic to be able to hold the kid who was not much smaller than herself up with one hand, but found that the arm she was holding was thin, and the boy was light enough that her well-trained muscles could easily catch him.</p><p>“Hey! Watch o-”</p><p>The boy was still in the middle of shouting to warn her when he realised he was no longer falling and looked up at her. His face paled as he took in her nice, clean clothes, and the dirt on the arm holding him up. Rozemyne’s face mirrored his shocked expression as she looked at the dirty blonde-haired boy quickly stepping away from her and finally had a good look at who just nearly crashed into her.</p><p>Lutz.</p><p>It took all of her noble training to turn her expression back to a pleasant smile, and stop herself from calling out his name. Lutz in the meanwhile reacted with just as much nervous energy as he did the first time meeting Benno in the last weave. She was dressed as a rich girl now, after all.</p><p>“Oh, uh, thanks for that. You’re str- OH NO, THE BAG!”</p><p>Rozemyne belatedly realised that while she managed to catch Lutz, she did not catch the small bag he was holding, which clattered to the cobblestone when they made impact. A handful of tiny feystones, none of them bigger than her thumb, were now scattered around them, with Lutz frantically trying to locate them all. She picked up the two tiny stones Lutz seemed to miss that she could easily find by enhancing her eyes, and handed them to her old friend.</p><p>“Are you going to sell those?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Was on mah way to the store.”</p><p>Lutz scratched his head awkwardly, clearly uncomfortable with trying to interact with her. She quickly made up her mind on how to spend her day on the spot, wanting to spend a bit more time with Lutz.</p><p>“Oh, I actually have one I would like to sell too. Could you take me there?”</p><p>“Huh? Sure. And uh, real sorry for, y’know, bumpin’ into you.”</p><p>He still seemed nervous, but at least he agreed to walk with her. She noticed he was looking anxiously at her shoulder, making her realize Hisui was still nested there.</p><p>“She is my pet, there is no need for you to worry.”</p><p>“Ah, um, okay…”</p><p>He didn’t seem very convinced, and Rozemyne finally noticed the people at the plaza staring at Hisui with wide eyes. That was a bit too much attention for her liking, when she already went through the trouble of getting a disguise to blend in better. After racking her brain for a moment, she opened the bag she was carrying on her left shoulder with her noble clothes and the few things she brought along with her.</p><p>“Hisui, in.”</p><p>Her little pet obediently jumped from her shoulder into the bag, moving around curiously at first until she settled with her head poking out at the top.</p><p>Lutz seemed to visibly relax after seeing the feybeast do as Rozemyne said, and they also attracted less and less attention as they walked along.</p><p>“So, what’s a rich girl doing goin’ to the store alone anyway?”</p><p>He was apparently comfortable enough to strike up a conversation, and Rozemyne realised she quickly needed to make up an excuse for her spontaneous downtown visit.</p><p>“Oh, I… Ah yes, I was actually on my way to some workshops to order a few things to be made.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Like what?”</p><p>It was perhaps a little bit early to “invent” the diptych again, but it would serve as a good excuse for her visit.</p><p>“Let’s see, I need two wooden frames around this big, then I will need some metal hinges and a metal stylus... Then just some wax, for now.”</p><p>She gestured with her hands to indicate the size of a small notebook she wanted, smiling to herself all the while.</p><p>‘Ah, this takes me back.’</p><p>Walking along with Lutz in downtown Ehrenfest, talking about what she needed for an invention was a distant but happy memory. It was nice reliving it for a moment, even under different circumstances.</p><p>“You want wood stuff? I can help, I’m an apprentice carpenter! I can take you to my family’s workshop if ya want, just gotta go to the stone shop first.”</p><p>She smiled at him, although she felt a little sad. So he was a carpenter, after all. Makes sense. There’s no way Lutz would be able to meet Benno without her interference.</p><p>“Oh, your family owns a workshop? My, how fortunate. May I ask for an introduction, then?”</p><p>“Nah, we just work there, but I can take ya. Boss’d be happy for a customer.”</p><p>Lutz had gone a bit red at her polite request, and she was again reminded of how much he struggled with polite speech in the beginning. It was easy to forget, after all the noble training she had to go through <em> thrice</em>.</p><p>They quickly reached the shop they were heading to, where Lutz proudly handed over the little bag of feystones he gathered from hunting in the forest, and received a couple coppers for it. She didn’t see what size coppers they were, but based on the amount and quality of feystones, she guessed middle coppers.</p><p>Rozemyne also took out a single feystone from the bag of feystone treats she brought along for Hisui, and happily accepted five large coppers for it. It was a bit of a low price for the quality, but it was not like she needed money anyways.</p><p>After the shop, they made their way to the craftsman alley, the stench getting stronger and the people looking more and more poor and malnourished along the way. Lutz asked a few more questions from her while they walked through alleyways he was clearly used to navigating, but it was not much more than small talk. She was a stranger to him in this life, after all.</p><p>She once again had to rely on her noble training to not burst out laughing the moment she saw the workshop Lutz stopped in front of.</p><p>“That’s my work. It’ll be a bit loud when we get in, but I’ll go get the boss for ya.”</p><p>She nodded with a smile as he pushed the door open and entered the store. A few of the workers who were nearby gave Lutz a surprised greeting, it was probably his day off so they were not expecting to see him. He took her off to the side to not be in anyone’s way and told her to stay there as he ran somewhere to the back.</p><p>She took her time looking around a bit. The smell of wood carving hanging in the air was actually more pleasant than the stench outside, making it easier for her to breathe.</p><p>“Here boss, this is the girl who wants to order something.”</p><p>Lutz’s voice was coming from behind her, not from the direction he disappeared in. His tone was a bit more respectful than before, which made sense considering he was just an apprentice, not even related to the workshop’s boss.</p><p>“Is that so, girlie? Whatcha got for m-”</p><p>The voice behind her froze as she turned around to face him. Next to Lutz stood a tall man in working clothes, with a towel covering his hair. She smiled widely at him and spoke first before he could react to her presence.</p><p>“Ingo! Long time no see. Ah, why didn’t you say you worked at Ingo’s workshop, uhm, what was your name?”</p><p>She turned back to Lutz, realising that they never exchanged names on the way here.</p><p>“L-Lutz, uh, miss.”</p><p>He stiffened up after hearing her address his boss so casually and not being reprimanded for it. Thankfully, he was facing Rozemyne, with Ingo behind his back, so he did not see the workshop owner’s face draining of all color.</p><p>“Well, thank you for escorting me here, Lutz. Here, take this for your trouble. I’m sure I will be fine by myself now.”</p><p>She handed one of the large coppers she got for the little feystone to Lutz, who accepted it with wide eyes. That was enough time for Ingo to come to his senses and understand her message once she gave him, and the door a pointed look, and he quickly shooed Lutz away and out of the store before the boy could protest.</p><p>“There’s no need for a greeting. I am in disguise. Treat me like a commoner.”</p><p>She stopped him from offering her greetings as soon as Lutz was out of sight and Igno’s movements indicated that he was about to sink to his knees before her. She spoke quietly so she wouldn’t be overheard by the other workers over the noise of the workshop before picking up her volume again and continuing the conversation in a bright, cheerful tone.</p><p>“As Lutz said, I have an order for you. I will need a moment to fill out an order form, but it should not be any more challenging than my previous order. I’m sure we can handle the payment and delivery the same way as before.”</p><p>Ingo hurriedly grabbed an order form, a pen and ink for her – earning a few surprised looks from the workers – nodding along in the meanwhile. He seemed to be struggling with treating her as a commoner, so he just opted not to say very much. It made sense. Even in the past weave, Ingo wasn’t the best at speaking to nobles.</p><p>“Here you go. I simply need two wooden frames of this size. I do not need them urgently, so just deliver them to the same location when they are ready. Is that alright?”</p><p>She asked for appearance’s sake, but she knew Ingo would not be able to say no to her anyways, not when he knew who she was. She at least did her best to sound nice.</p><p>“Of course! That will be no problem, L-”</p><p>A quick glare from her made him stop in his tracks. </p><p>“L- Little lady! Hahaha… Yeah, we can have this done soon. I will get to you as soon as it’s complete.”</p><p>“Thank you ever so much.”</p><p>The order form exchanged hands, with some extra written instructions for delivery and payment, and she quickly left the workshop, followed by many curious eyes. Ingo awkwardly bid her goodbye, with his hand scratching his head after he nearly crossed his arms in deference.</p><p>His fumbling was a little amusing, but at the same time Rozemyne was not in the mood to get her disguise ruined so soon and in front of so many people. She briefly considered visiting Gustav too to give him instructions on how she should be treated when in disguise. She decided against it in the end. She wasn’t likely to run into him or Freida in public anyways, and Benno can explain the situation to Ingo. Benno sure was getting busy already despite having practically none of the industries from the last weave…</p><hr /><p>“Well, hello there, lil’ missy.”</p><p>She really needed to start paying more direct attention to her surroundings. She paid no mind to the scruffy people hurrying along the street, which proved to be a mistake as three men who were walking alongside her seemed to have subtly guided her away from the main street into an alley. It was kind of lame that she had fallen for such a cheap trick. One of them flashed a sickly sweet, toothless grin at her as he held out a rusty little dagger in front of him, pointing right at her chest.</p><p>“If ya stay nice an’ calm no one’s gonna get hurt, missy. We gonna make a detour now, an’ you will follow quietly.”</p><p>Hisui must have hidden herself better in her bag while she was in the workshop because the man didn’t seem to have his guard up at all. She could have just opened her bag, letting her little pet handle the rest, but after how much attention she attracted at the square, the other commoners would have definitely been terrified. Plus, she had no patience for scum like them. She glanced around for a few seconds. There truly were no direct witnesses around, so she could just deal with them herself, <em> right? </em></p><p>She returned the man’s grin for a moment, with an edge of <em> danger </em>, like a wild animal before it pounced on its prey, and she was moving before her assailants had the time to process her expression or react to her charge.</p><p>Using enhancement magic, she took a sudden step forward with her right foot, angling her body sideways and away from the weapon pointed at her. Letting her left arm relax allowed her to let her bag slide from her shoulder, dropping to the ground and out of her way. Using her other hand she grabbed at the wrist of the one threatening her and twisted it with force, the snap echoing in the alley announced her success as she slapped the dagger down, where it buried itself into the ground. Before he could even scream in pain, she rammed her elbow into his stomach, making him fly away a short distance. Having dealt with the most obvious threat allowed her to further analyze his compatriots. The one on her left was staring at the place her first victim flew with wide eyes. Using his distraction, she advanced at him next.</p><p>He was unable to react as she simply stepped on his foot, causing him to lower his torso to grab at it in a hunch. Rozemyne used the fact she could now reach his head to simply give his forehead a flick, making him crumble to the ground. Only one more assailant to go. </p><p>She turned around to see that her last “kidnapper” had drawn a rusty dagger as well, shaking in his boots as he held it in her direction with fear obvious on his face.</p><p>“Wha, wha, wait a m- moment!”</p><p>Rozemyne did not wait. Instead, she slowly walked in his direction placing her right foot on the top of the handle of the dagger she stabbed into the ground earlier.</p><p>“You ruffians really thought you could rob or even kidnap <em> me</em>?”</p><p>She pushed the weapon down into the ground until only its handle poked out. Hisui appeared at her side, a low hiss emanating from her furry companion.</p><p>“How brave you are.”</p><p>The one blocking the exit of the alley dropped his weapon, falling to his rear in muted terror at both of them.</p><p>“...Or not.”</p><p>Rozemyne slowly advanced as he began to crawl backwards away from her. She took the rusted dagger up from the ground with fluid movements, never slowing in her stride towards him. The light from the main street greeted her again as she stepped on his left shin. The breaking sound was followed by a howl of agony.</p><p>“You scum should really think twice before bothering a young lady.”</p><p>“Halt! Put the weapon down and step aside!”</p><p>Rozemyne and Hisui looked to the side in unison to see a small group of soldiers running towards them. She supposed going through the proper channels for justice would suffice. She could always demand their execution if any of the kidnappers tried to make the issue go away with money, but she was not exactly fond of the idea. Hopefully, just scaring them this much would be enough.</p><p>Four soldiers grabbed the men off the ground, and two turned towards her. She smiled as she recognised the familiar face of one of them, but the gesture was not returned.</p><p>“Did you bring that beast into the town, little lady? I don’t know how you managed to get it through the gate, but feybeasts are not allowed in town. They are dangerous, has your family not told you that?”</p><p>“Otto is right, you know. We’ve been getting reports of the creature all day. We’re gonna have to remove it from the city and speak to your parents about this. You can take us to them, or you can come to the gate with us and we’ll send an apprentice to get them. Your choice, kid.”</p><p>‘That… would be an issue. Should I just reveal myself? No, this would be such a big scene, Mother would definitely hear about it… UGH, why is it so hard to pretend to be a commoner for just one day? Time to put the brain to work. Think, Rozemyne!</p><p>‘Otto is here with the soldiers, so that means he must be married to Corinna in this weave too, and knowing Benno… Yeah, he would have complained about me to him for sure. If I could just give him a hint, he could probably put two and two together… Okay! Time for my best acting skills! Aaaand, action!’</p><p>With a plan in mind, Rozemyne tilted her head to the side, cheek resting in the palm of your left hand in the perfect Angelica pose. She made sure to look convincingly troubled, but angled herself in a way that made sure Otto got a good glimpse of the ring on her finger.</p><p>“Oh dear. I did not wish to cause alarm, my dear Hisui is perfectly domesticated. She is my guard, I cannot part with her. You see, my mother would be awfully cross if I were to be downtown without my guard. Perhaps my Hisui could be excused just this once?”</p><p>She saw the gears turning in Otto’s head while the other soldier just gave her a strange look, so she gave him one last push.</p><p>“May Anhaltung grace you…”</p><p>She said it almost wordlessly, looking directly at Otto. If he was still responsible for reading noble letters of introductions and such, she hoped he would recognise the mention of the God as a noble turn of phrase.</p><p>The other soldier did not catch her last sentence, just as she intended, but he was also looking at her nervously. He looked like he decided she was <em> rich </em> rich, and was clearly considering how strong his sense of duty was – strong enough to follow his orders and risk angering some influential family?</p><p>Otto, in the meanwhile, stared at her with wide eyes, looking from her ring, to her hair to Hisui… Eventually paling at the realisation, clenching his hands as they started to shake. But he plastered a friendly smile on his face, the same expression she’d seen him make in the past before going to placate some noble or another who was waiting at the gate.</p><p>“Ah yes, of course, we wouldn’t want to worry your family. Now that I look at your <em> Hisui </em> up close, I see she is not dangerous at all, so there will be no need for us to remove her. Our mistake, my apologies.”</p><p>“Otto? What are you-”</p><p>“If you would excuse us for a moment.”</p><p>The other soldier was clearly confused by Otto’s nervous apology, but her old friend dragged his colleague away before he could question the odd behaviour. The confused soldier didn’t seem to notice that Otto actually waited for Rozemyne to nod in agreement to his request before stepping away, as if waiting for dismissal from a superior. Which suited Rozemyne just fine. It would have been harder for Otto to explain that one, probably.</p><p>Still, to be sure the secret conversation was not causing her any more trouble, she enhanced her hearing to listen to the two men’s quiet whispers.</p><p>“Why did you tell her she can go? The Captain said to get rid of the beast and bring in the person responsible!”</p><p>“Quiet, you idiot! That’s a noble! Do you not see her ring? Remember what the nobles are like going through the gate, do you really want to take one there against her will? <em> Summon her parents?!”</em></p><p>Rozemyne only saw the back of their heads, but it was still easy to see when the younger man frantically shook his head. He must have been quite new if he didn’t recognise a noble ring, she thought.</p><p>“W-w-w-what do we do, then?”</p><p>“We apologise, be <em> very </em> polite, take those rascals out of her sight as fast as possible, and hope she is young enough not to want to demand an execution. Then leave the rest to the Captain and my brother-in-law to figure out.”</p><p>“What? Your brother-in-law? What does he have to do with this?”</p><p>Otto’s shoulders seemed to slump ever so slightly as Rozemyne heard him sigh.</p><p>“That is far too long to explain now. I’ll go talk to the lady, and you try to inform the others. Try to be subtle.”</p><p>They finally turned back around, only to be met by Rozemyne’s gaze, watching them with an amused look. The young soldier turned beet red, bowed his head to her and quickly rushed to the others, who were still tying up the shouting prisoners.</p><p>Very subtle.</p><p>“Ah, apologies about that. Please be assured that we will take care of the men who bothered you. There is no need to come with us to the gate for any reason.”</p><p>“How reassuring. I am sure my parents will be happy not to be <em> summoned </em> to the gate.”</p><p>She smirked as Otto paled, likely realising that she heard their conversation. What did he expect, it’s not like they could go very far from her to talk…</p><p>“I-I apologise, I meant no offense, I was simply-”</p><p>She held up her hand to cut him off.</p><p>“It is quite alright. There is no need for a soldier to be so polite to a simple daughter of a rich commoner family, is there? Oh, but do say hi to your wife for me. She did excellent work adjusting this dress for me.”</p><p>She was hoping the message would be clear enough. Treat me like a commoner, I know who you are, you will not be punished for it.</p><p>“Ah, yes of course. The dress looks lovely on you… miss… I should have realised Corinna made it. Her work is the best, she is so talented. I’ll be sure to tell her that you are satisfied.”</p><p>Otto still seemed unsure, not addressing her as a noble lady, but after an encouraging nod from her, his smile finally widened, happy to praise his wife. Some things never change…</p><p>She bid Otto farewell, thumping her chest twice with her hand as a salute, the gesture returned by all six soldiers. They all seemed to be relieved to see her go now that they were informed of her identity. She called out to Hisui, who once again obediently jumped into her bag, hidden away from the gawking commoners, and finally they were on their way to their final destination. A smithy.</p><hr /><p>She remembered only one smithy from the last weave, and she didn’t feel like sticking around the crowd for any longer to ask for directions to a different one. It was a strange feeling to be walking to the old smithy with no Lutz or Mark accompanying her, and knowing that she no longer had her own smith to do her orders with exceptional precision did make her a bit sad, but there was nothing to be done about that. She did not need high precision this time anyways, just a simple stylus. The foreman should be perfectly capable of taking that order and assigning it to any blacksmith.</p><p>“But boss! Please, just give me one more chance!”</p><p>“I have given you more chances that I should, kid. My hands are tied. I can’t leave you with a customer, I can’t have you working in a team and I can’t even get you on the bulk orders. What am I supposed to do with you?”</p><p>It seemed Dregarnuhr was quite intent on crossing her thread with as many old acquaintances as she could that day. The sight that greeted her as soon as she stepped inside the workshop was both surprising, and at the same time, not really.</p><p>Johann stood with a small box of tools by his feet in front of an exasperated foreman, begging with a truly desperate look.</p><p>“I can do the work! I can do any of the work, I just-”</p><p>“That’s the problem, kid. I know you have skills, but what’s it to me when someone needs to babysit you through every job? I can’t pay two people for one job. Look kid, I kept you on as a lehange after you failed your patron task. You would have been a fine smith if you managed to find just one patron who could put up with your questions. But I can’t protect you anymore, kid. Not when it costs me.“</p><p>“But… What do I do, then?”</p><p>The foreman – Rozemyne racked her brain for his name but just could not remember it – shrugged at that.</p><p>“You can go work at the gate. There’s always a need for more soldiers. Or you could try to find someone to hire you as a smith without a workshop, but that’s unli-”</p><p>“I’ll hire him.”</p><p>The two heads whipped around to find the source of the interruption, only to see her standing in the doorway.</p><p>The foreman – seriously, what was his name?! Rozemyne thought her memory and blessings of Anhaltung were better than that… Perhaps <em> that </em> petty brat was messing with her just to frustrate her for no reason… But regardless, Nameless Foreman just laughed at her heartily, the tension in his face easing a little bit, while Johann just looked back and forth between the two of them.</p><p>“That’s sweet, girlie, but you should stay out of business you don’t understand. Did you come here to deliver an order form for your parents? Shouldn’t you have a servant or a guard with you? It is good practice to come to a workshop yourself, but you shouldn’t run away from the people looking after you.”</p><p>The concern was touching, but she didn’t like the disappointed look on Johann’s face as Nameless changed the topic so quickly. But she had no reason to give work to someone she didn’t even really know over her first Gutenberg. So she just smiled and pressed on.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, but it is unnecessary. I have an order, for myself, not for my parents, but I think I want <em> him </em>to take it now.”</p><p>The foreman sighed and rubbed his forehead as Johann’s face once again lit up with hope.</p><p>“Well, it is not that simple, but… Well, he does not work here now, so it’s not like I can stop you. Why don’t you talk to him about your order first, and then decide?”</p><p>Rozemyne grinned, knowing full well Nameless Foreman was expecting her to change her mind once Johann started asking his questions. But he was a fool for she had the ultimate weapon! Answers!</p><p>“Thank you so much, miss! My name is Johann. What can I help you with?”</p><p>Johann leapt towards her as soon as her gaze shifted to him, voice full of eagerness and just a hint of desperation. Her unsuspecting (and unplanned) prey was already as good as caught in her (also unplanned) trap.</p><p>“I need something called a stylus, a small metal stick to use to write similarly to how you write with chalk. But it should be thin enough to be easy to hold, and have a small tip.”</p><p>Johann nodded along, taking notes on a slate he quickly pulled out from the box at his feet.</p><p>“Just how small do you want the tip to be, exactly?”</p><p>“About three times the thickness of a sewing needle should work.</p><p>“You said you want it easy to hold, but is it going to be used by you or someone else? Which thickness do you find easy to hold?”</p><p>She picked up a couple of the chalk pieces she could see until she found one she could use for comparison.</p><p>“About half of the thickness of this one.”</p><p>Johann quickly observed the piece of chalk up close before drawing a small circle on his slate.</p><p>“Would this diameter work?”</p><p>She placed her fingers over the drawing as if trying to hold the circle in a pen grip, and nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>“Should both of the ends be pointy like this?”</p><p>“Oh, now that you mention it, no, I want one of the ends to be flat and wide, kind of like this.”</p><p>She drew a shape in a corner of the slate to not interfere with Johann’s notes, which led to even more questions.</p><p>“What will you be using the flat end for? Is that also for writing? How wide should the end be? And what angle should this part be?”</p><p>She answered each question happily, giving either measurements or demonstrations with her fingers. She almost forgot how much fun it was to innovate with Johann. She could not <em> wait </em> to get started on the printing press again. And yet, that was still a long ways away…</p><p>The foreman’s eyebrows began to travel up his forehead the more Rozemyne stood there with Johann, answering his questions without any sign of frustration. They moved on to discuss hinges, and the clip and rings for the rest of the frame, and as the details started coming together, Johann was getting more and more enthusiastic. Nameless Foreman was even smiling at the pair by the time their discussion died down.</p><p>“Just one last question, miss. How much should this stylus be embellished?”</p><p>“For now, it should just have an ornate R carved into it. But if I am happy with your work, I might commission more, with more detailed decoration.”</p><p>“Understood. I now have all the details I need to make your order. Oh, but…”</p><p>Johann’s enthusiasm suddenly died down as he seemed to realise something, and looked sheepishly back at his former boss.</p><p>“Well, girlie, what is your decision? Do you want to hire this guy?”</p><p>The Nameless Foreman was now looking at her with more consideration, but he still seemed like he was preparing for some bad news for some reason.</p><p>“Of course. I see no reason why I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Uh, miss… I sort of… don’t have a place to do the work, now.”</p><p>Ah, so that was it. Poor Johann was looking close to tears, and the workshop foreman was standing there awkwardly, probably considering whether he should offer to hire Johann again if it meant he would gain her as a customer. At least he didn’t seem like he was questioning whether she had the money to afford the order in the first place.</p><p>Well, she was not about to let the workshop take her smith when she was so close to securing him for herself!</p><p>“Oh, that’s not a problem. Mister Foreman, I assume there is a space in this workshop that Johann used to work in. I would like to rent out that space for <em> my </em> smith.”</p><p>“There is, but rent the space? That… Listen, girlie, I know merchants operate differently to workshops, but we don’t rent space in our workshop. And it wouldn’t come cheap even if we did.”</p><p>Johann looked even more crestfallen than before, but Rozemyne simply assumed her trusted Angelica pose.</p><p>“My, how troubling. And here I thought this would be enough for you to consider my offer.”</p><p>She produced a large silver piece from her pockets and flashed the coin in front of the two smiths, who both stared at her with such wide eyes that for a moment she worried their eyes might pop out.</p><p>“Of course, if that is not enough, I would happily offer three or four large silvers for the space, instead. <em> Merchants </em> know the value of good connections, after all.”</p><p>The foreman sputtered and waved his hands in front of her.</p><p>“One large silver is already enough to cover the worth of the space for half a season, little miss. It would be more than enough. But are you sure about this? It would be much cheaper for you to simply order from my workshop.”</p><p>It was an odd thing. Now that he knew Rozemyne would pay as much as a large silver for him just for the space in the back, he was still trying to save her money, giving himself less profit in the process too. Rozemyne decided that Nameless Foreman was a nice man. Nice enough that she really should remember his name. Maybe she’ll ask Benno or Gustav about it sometime.</p><p>She smiled at him.</p><p>“Yes, I am sure. Let us call it a test run.”</p><p>The foreman studied her face for a little bit, before eventually agreeing to her strange request. He wrote a quick agreement down on the back of an order form, not exactly a contract, but enough to show the terms they agreed on, and took the silver coin from Rozemyne. She was not very keen on having her own name down on the agreement, so at her insistence, the foreman wrote that <em> Johann </em> was hiring the workspace for the cost of one large silver. Johann was practically vibrating with excitement, so she turned towards him to explain her conditions.</p><p>“Like I said, let’s call this a test run, Johann. For now, I will just commission this order from you, and cover your workshop rent and materials until you complete it. If I am happy with the result, I am willing to make this arrangement permanent, and employ you as my personal smith. Is that agreeable for you?”</p><p>“Yes, miss! But, uhh… Where do I deliver the order to when it is complete?”</p><p>Ah, that was a fair question and a bit of an issue. He would definitely not believe her if she said to deliver it to a mansion in the noble district, not to mention the questions it would lead to about when she managed to make the order in the first place, when she supposedly never left the mansion alone… No, it was better not to even consider that. So she simply asked for a wooden board to use – they could give her as much after paying for use of the workshop – and quickly and elegantly wrote a few simple lines on it.</p><p>“The delivery might be a little… complicated. I am not able to move about in the city freely very often.”</p><p>Both Johann and the foreman nodded in understanding, probably thinking that it was strange for her to be there alone in the first place, despite her earlier reassurance.</p><p>“If you hand this to Benno of the Gilberta company, he will know how to contact me and arrange a meeting.”</p><p>That was probably also the right thing for her to do, as neither of them reacted to the request strangely. It was probably not very unusual for children of merchant families to be reached through their parents or other relatives. Not that Benno had any children, so they probably just assumed he was an uncle or other distant relative. That was fine by her.</p><p>The message she left with them was nothing complicated. It simply explained that the boy had an order to deliver to her, and if Benno receives this letter, he should let her know at his earliest convenience. She simply signed it with an ornate R. t. T., not wanting to give her name away just yet. That could wait until she officially hired Johann all for herself.</p><p>“Thank you so much, miss! I will not disappoint you.”</p><p>“I look forward to seeing what you can do. Hmm, but I feel like I am forgetting something…”</p><p>She looked around the workshop and to the two men in front of her, searching for any clues. She was sure there was something else she should do, but what? She gave her order, made a deal with the foreman, explained the conditions to Johann… Ah, Johann.</p><p>“You have expenses too, don’t you. Food and rent, and… Not sure what else people pay for. Here you go.”</p><p>She handed Johann one of the large silver coins remaining in her pocket, waved goodbye to the two men, and walked out of the workshop happily. It was quite the productive day, aside from the few hiccups she was not prepared for. But it was about time for her to head back to her teleportation circle and return to her hidden room to make sure none of her retainers would get suspicious.</p><p>She was already walking along the street a few shops away from the workshop when her sensitive hearing picked up the muffled shout of the familiar voice of her favourite blacksmith.</p><p>“WHAT THE-”</p>

    <p>Benno woke up bright and early, heading down to his store after sharing a hearty breakfast with Corinna. His goofy brother-in-law, Otto, had already left for his shift at the gate as a soldier, and his trusted assistant, Mark, was hard at work opening the store and getting the apprentices in order. As he expected, Mark was ready for him with a report on the most important orders for the day, and the stock levels he needed to check over once Benno found him on the shop floor.</p><p>It was a busy day, they had already received a large order as soon as they opened, and as he scanned the floor, he could see not only rich merchants, but some attendants of laynoble houses looking through their catalogues. They were not prepared for such an influx of orders, so Mark was urging him to purchase a larger stock of high quality fabrics than usual. A reasonable suggestion, and yet his pocket hurt from the thought of such large expenses. So, to soothe his heart, he went through the order forms with Mark one by one, looking for anything going out of fashion that they could order less of. It ended up being a longer discussion than either of them expected.</p><p>Satisfied, he headed to the back of the shop to work in his office for the rest of the day. He opened the door casually, only to be frozen in shock and fear at the sight that greeted him.</p><p>

</p><p>As much as merchants liked the money their noble customers brought in, which could not be compared to even a dozen commoner customers, no sane merchant would wish to find the sole daughter of a high-ranking archnoble family sitting in an armchair in their office. Especially <em> that </em> noble daughter! It was unexpected. Even worse, she appeared to be unaccompanied, grinning, and holding a feybeast in her hands.</p><p>He could not stop the scream that escaped his lips, completely caught off guard by the sight. Not knowing what to do, his reflexes took over, and he instinctively closed the door, as if that would make the horrifying sight go away.</p><p>“Master Benno, are you alright?”</p><p>The apprentice who was managing the back of the shop was looking at him with a worried expression.</p><p>“Hm? Oh, yes, yes, I merely thought I saw something. I’ll be in my office now. Go let Mark know that I am <b>not</b> to be disturbed under <b>any circumstances</b>, understood?”</p><p>“Yessir.”</p><p>He was far from alright, but there was no reason to make his staff worry. He may have just deeply offended an archnoble, after all. There was a good chance they would all soon be executed… Or, considering it was Lady Rozemyne, even worse. A cold shiver traveled down his spine, but he could not keep the lady waiting any longer. He would just have to hope that he could appease her somehow.</p><p>Those thoughts flew out of his mind as soon as the conversation began. She started by scolding him for not having reported to her sooner. On what he was not sure, but it was not the time to ask questions. She didn’t even follow the customary noble greetings, another sure sign that she was displeased, before giving him an order, no, a challenge to prepare clothing for her immediately.</p><p>“M-May I be excused to bring our best seamstress for you, Milady?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>At the question, Lady Rozemyne smiled kindly and gave him a little nod. Benno took this as a sign that he finally said the right thing for the first time in this conversation, and Lady Rozemyne indeed wanted Corinna’s services.</p><p>Rather than sending a servant like he normally would, he ran up the stairs himself, practically jumping over multiple steps at a time, and flung the door to Corinna and Otto’s place wide open.</p><p>“Corinna! Come quick!”</p><p>He shouted for her, and she came running with a scared expression.</p><p>“What is it, Brother? Is something wrong?”</p><p>“There’s a noble… Lady Rozemyne… In my office… right now!”</p><p>He was breathing hard, trying to get his words out but catch his breath at the same time. He was not used to running around.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne is here? What for?”</p><p>Corinna looked bewildered, which, in her defence, was the appropriate reaction, but it was not the time for it! Thankfully, he finally managed to speak in proper sentences, so he did his best to explain it as quickly as he could.</p><p>“She wants some commoner clothes to be able to walk around downtown <em> today</em>. She seems quite unhappy with us too, this might be a test. Just bring whatever you need and do your best to not anger her any more!”</p><p>That might not have been the best way of putting it, as his sister looked downright frightened, but the stakes were high. She quickly gathered everything she needed with shaky hands, and hurried down the stairs behind him.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, I have brought my sister, Corinna. She is the best seamstress in all of Ehrenfest. You may remember her from your time-”</p><p>He was doing his best to confidently re-introduce Corinna and drum up her skills a bit to make Lady Rozemyne feel like they are treating her appropriate to her status when he realised he made a mistake. He was about to remind the little noble that she and his sister already met at the temple when he realised how much of a taboo it was to mention such things to nobles. He faltered, the blood draining from his face as the young lady was simply… staring at him! He tried to come up with anything he could say to cover his mistake.</p><p>“Ehm, from your time before your baptism.”</p><p>Eventually, he coughed and finished sheepishly with the best thing he could come up with. Corinna smoothly knelt and offered her greeting to the little lady, who returned the greeting this time – small mercies. She was even smiling <em> fondly </em> at his sister.</p><p>‘Is it just <em> me </em>she has an issue with? That is a scary thought too. If what Gustav told me is right, then…’</p><p>“Thank you for coming, Corinna. I’ll be in your care, then. Benno, you may leave now to allow your sister to work.”</p><p>And just like that, he was dismissed from his own office. He paced anxiously in front of the door for a couple moments, once again bringing much attention to himself. He cursed under his breath, and began giving out instructions to his staff.</p><p>“You, bring me the highest quality dresses we have that are suitable for merchants’ daughters. Get everything you can find from baptism age to adult! You, get some high quality thread in summer colors! What else, what else… Oh, you…”</p><p>He continued until all of the apprentices had something to do, either looking through their storage, or preparing all the equipment and materials for Corinna to modify the dress they end up selecting. He also ordered Mark to prepare their highest quality tea in the meanwhile, who simply did as instructed with a curious expression.</p><p>When Corinna signaled that the measuring was done, he sent a female servant in with the dresses and materials they gathered, plus the tea set. Benno himself simply stood outside the door like a guard the whole time, making sure that Corinna could work uninterrupted, and keeping all the apprentices away from the girl who could doom them all. The last thing he needed was one of them offending her further and undoing all his hard work.</p><p>Half a bell later, Corinna and the servant emerged from the room with shaky smiles, and he carefully knocked on the door.</p><p>“Come in, Benno.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne was once again sitting in the chair where he first saw her, but this time dressed as a commoner. Corinna even tied a piece of cloth on her head, so her beautifully shiny hair didn’t attract as much attention, as only two braids poked out from under the cloth. The only thing ruining the illusion was the wild beast sitting comfortably on her shoulder, watching his every move.</p><p>He finally let out a sigh of relief only when the door closed behind the girl, who left immediately after complimenting his, and by extension, Corinna’s work. He raised his head, slowly getting up from the place where he knelt, already massaging his temple as his eyes landed on something on his desk.</p><p>There stood a gorgeous glass bottle, from the shape and clarity of the glass it was already worth at least a small gold, filled with some shimmering liquid and a note attached on a small piece of thin wood. The note simply explained that Lady Rozemyne was satisfied with their work today, and to show her appreciation, the bottle contained two doses of special rinsham, enough for Benno and Corinna to use once. Special rinsham, brewed by Lady Rozemyne <em> herself!</em> Containing the blessings of the Goddess of Flowers Efflorelume!!!</p><p>His face paled as he put the bottle down as gently as he could, even taking a step back after for good measure. Leaving something this valuable, Benno wasn’t sure if a lifetime of their services would be enough to repay Lady Rozemyne for it. There was absolutely no way he could just use it! Half of that bottle, his “portion” based on the note, was likely worth about the same as the entire store!</p><p>His previous relief was gone again. He could not decide if he just walked into a trap, or if this really was the most expendable thing the little lady owned. Either way, he could already foresee more headaches in his future.</p><hr /><p>He didn’t usually like to join Corinna and Otto for dinner in their home above his for the simple reason that any time he did, Otto just went on and on about Corinna. Nonstop. It was unbearable. But just this once, the thought of it seemed so normal, that he desperately craved it after the day he had.</p><p>So once the store was closed and the employees left, he made his way one floor higher than usual, knocking on his sister’s door, expecting the grinning soldier to let him in.</p><p>“Oh, Brother. I thought you were Otto. Come in.”</p><p>“Is Otto not home yet?”</p><p>The place already smelled like freshly cooked food as Corinna returned to the pot on the hearth, Otto nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Oh, you know, must be something at the gate. It is not that late yet. I just hope he will be home before dinner.”</p><p>Benno poured himself a cup of tea and made himself comfortable in one of the chairs. They didn’t speak very much while they waited, but the silence was comfortable. It was a welcome break after the mess of the day.</p><p>After Benno’s second cup of tea, the door finally opened and Otto walked in, looking just as exhausted as Benno felt.</p><p>“Welcome home, dear. Dinner is cooked already, so go change and wash up while I set the table.”</p><p>Otto kissed Corinna, then shot Benno an odd look before heading to their bedroom to change. He was probably not happy to see Benno when he thought he was coming home to his wife after a long day, but he would just have to deal with it. </p><p>He helped his sister set the table, and his brother-in-law soon joined them in clean, comfortable clothes.</p><p>“What took you so long?”</p><p>“I’ve had one hell of a day. I’ll tell you all about it, but first – food. I am starving.”</p><p>Benno snorted at that.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure your day at the gate was <em> awful</em>. Let me guess, some noble complaining that the paperwork was taking too long. Poor you. I guarantee whatever issues you had to deal with, it’s nothing compared to the day I had.”</p><p>Otto murmured something in response, but they were distracted from their bickering by the steaming hot food Corinna placed on the table. It was nothing particularly fancy, meat and vegetables boiled until tender, then tossed in a pan with a little butter to crisp up the edges. The butter and meat was expensive, but he was proud his company earned him enough to not have to worry about feeding his family. It was a point of pride for Benno, after taking over the family business at a young age.</p><p>Of course, after accidentally being blessed – or cursed – with archnoble connections, the profits were even higher than before, but the stress that came with knowing Lady Rozemyne was bad for his heart and his poor hairline. He shook his head to make the thoughts disappear, just as Otto finally started to regale them with the excitements of his day.</p><p>“Well, it all started around third bell, when we started getting reports of feybeasts being spotted inside city walls.”</p><p>Corinna gasped at the revelation, and Benno raised his eyebrows too. As far as he knew, feybeasts couldn’t simply get into the city thanks to the magic of the archduke. Otto continued, enjoying their immediate reaction, talking like he was telling a story to the apprentice soldiers.</p><p>“The first report came from the central plaza, so a group from the Eastern Gate was sent out to investigate, but get this. They encountered no feybeasts on the way there. The plaza was as peaceful as ever, and there wasn’t even any damage from feybeasts anywhere. So, they sent messengers to the other gates to keep an eye out.”</p><p>Benno was really beginning to think Otto was making a big deal out of nothing just to hog the attention for a bit. The whole stray feybeast idea was ludicrous, but a rogue feybeast that cannot be found and does no damage? That had to be fake.</p><p>“Was it a false alarm, then?”</p><p>Otto shook his head, and continued, a bit more serious now.</p><p>“I would have assumed it was only a prank, but there were multiple reports at the same time. Something strange was going on. But then!”</p><p>He paused for a very annoying dramatic effect. Benno was getting frustrated with his dramatics.</p><p>“Not long after the messenger from the Eastern Gate left, another arrived from the Western Gate, to inform us that reports were made of feybeasts hiding in people’s bags and clothes near the market!”</p><p>Benno snorted, the idea was just that ridiculous. What kind of feybeast would hide in people’s <em> clothes</em>? And how? Maybe people ate some strange feyplant again and were getting sick from it. That would be a better explanation for the odd reports, and explain why Otto had to stay in so long. And yet, he had a bad feeling…</p><p>“The Western Gate soldiers found nothing when they arrived, so we were all sent out to patrol the city to look for <em> hiding feybeasts </em> or suspicious individuals who might be pranking the citizens. I thought I found a lead when I overheard some apprentices talking about a strange animal, but…”</p><p>Otto looked awkward for a second, as if not wanting to tell this part of the story, but he eventually just sighed and looked away as he continued.</p><p>“Kids… They didn’t know me, so they just ran away. They probably thought they were in trouble.”</p><p>Corinna put a hand on her husband’s arm reassuringly. It reminded Benno that Otto found it a sore spot that he and Corinna still had no child. He didn’t have the heart to laugh at how Otto fumbled the possible lead.</p><p>“Well, my group was just about to head back to the gate, when some people told us about a commotion in the craftsman alley. I was absolutely sure we finally found the feybeast! But it turned out, they were reporting that they witnessed a <em> kidnapping</em>! Well, attempted kidnapping, I should say.”</p><p>Benno’s face darkened. There wasn’t a lot of crime in Ehrenfest city. It was much safer than out on the road as a travelling merchant, and he was grateful for his fortune to be born here. But kidnapping wasn’t exactly rare either. Children and wives of wealthy families, or families of rivaling workshops, did disappear from the streets and alleys every now and then. Sometimes they were returned for ransom, trade secrets or highly unfavourable contracts, but other times…</p><p>“Imagine my surprise when we get to the scene of the commotion to find that the kidnappers were targeting a little girl, wearing the loveliest dress, clearly made by the most talented seamstress in Ehrenfest, and the most beautiful one too, clearly an <em> expert</em>-”</p><p>Corinna threw her Husband an exasperated look before clearing her throat and poking him in the ribs. It was obvious that the continuous praise was becoming annoying to her as well. How did his sister even deal with someone like Otto on a regular basis?</p><p>“Ehm, so a little girl… with a feybeast! I don’t suppose you know of a little girl in possession of a finely crafted dress from my wife, and a feybeast… Benno?!”</p><p>Benno and Corinna both paled. They were, in fact, very familiar with a certain young lady of that description… Benno gulped. This was supposed to be his relaxing dinner to recover from his interaction with the menace!</p><p>“What… did you do?”</p><p>“Oh, you know, probably nearly got myself executed trying to arrest a noble! Could you not have told me that you let a noble loose in commoner clothing in the city? One that is capable of beating three grown men into a pulp for trying to touch her?”</p><p>Otto was staring daggers at him now, while Benno felt like he was about to be sick. Maybe having dinner first was not the best idea.</p><p>“Did… the soldiers-?”</p><p>Otto threw his hand into the air, waving the concerned question away as if he didn’t even want to consider the consequences of such actions.</p><p>“Oh heavens, no, the kidnappers. She left them all alive, or at least they were alive when we got there and she allowed us to take them away. But we were about to take her to the gate! My head hurts just thinking about how that would have gone… Luckily, she seemed to know who I was and made a show of her ring so I didn’t make more of a fool of myself than I already had.”</p><p>“Was she angry?”</p><p>Corinna asked the question on both of their minds timidly. She was already displeased with Benno in the morning, and while Corinna’s work seemed to have placated her, if she knew who Otto was and the soldiers treated her with anything less than the utmost respect…</p><p>“No, she was actually quite… kind. And very lenient. We all made it out alive, after all.”</p><p>Well that did not sound like the same person at all. Then again, nobles were the masters of disguising their thoughts and emotions. If she was planning to demand justice or simply take matters into her own hands like she – allegedly – has done before, there was no way Otto would have been able to tell.</p><p>“So she recognised you, huh… I wouldn’t call that lucky, but did she say anything about us, then?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, she did! She praised Corinna very openly! See, even the nobles know how amazing my wife is!”</p><p>This was a serious problem! Otto’s obsession with his wife was beginning to give him a headache as well, could he not praise Corinna for at least a few moments?</p><p>“You are unbelievable… What about me? Did she say anything?”</p><p>Benno did <em> not </em> like the superior smirk on Otto’s face.</p><p>“Nope!”</p><p>Well, he might as well start preparing for his climb up the towering heights. If this was not a sure sign that he had completely fallen out of the little devil’s favour, he didn’t know what was.</p><hr /><p>The Gilberta company returned to some level of normalcy after that day. For some time, it was almost peaceful. He was on edge for a couple days, expecting to hear news of devastation brought to the lower city by an angry noble girl and her family, but nothing of the sort happened.</p><p>The peace, however, did not last very long, as his next headache came in the form of a young craftsman, of all people.</p><p>About a week after his encounter with the young archnoble, Mark entered his office, announcing that an apprentice smith was quite desperately trying to request a meeting with him.</p><p>“A smith? What does he want with me?”</p><p>“The young man didn’t explain very much, sir. However, he appears to have a board, looking similar to an invitation, that he would like to personally deliver to you. I have not had the opportunity to read it yet.”</p><p>“He asked for me by name?”</p><p>He was in half a mind to send the boy away without seeing him. Mark would have known if he was the child of one of the workshop owners, they were occasionally sent as part of their apprentice training to handle business on behalf of their parents as they neared coming of age. It was a smart way to help the children establish themselves and find patrons, interacting with merchants while delivering quality products. But for a random smith to come and ask for him by name? That was highly unusual.</p><p>“Yessir. He was quite insistent that it is not business for the Gilberta company, but for you personally.”</p><p>“Ah, what the hell. Send him in. Let’s see what he wants.”</p><p>Mark only looked surprised for a moment before nodding in acknowledgement and disappearing through his office door, only to return shortly with the nervous looking young man. He was definitely not an apprentice, looked to be just past coming of age. His hands were clenching the sides of a simple wooden board, holding it tightly in front of his chest. The young man cleared his throat and stepped forward.</p><p>“Blessed be the blaze of the sun.”</p><p>“Ah, indeed. Blessed be the blaze of the sun. May the God of Summer's eternal strength fuel you.”</p><p>Benno was not expecting to hear the traditional merchant greeting from a smith, clearly the boy had prepared for the meeting. It made him suspicious.</p><p>“Erm, I’m sorry for the intrusion, sir, but I have completed the order for your daughter and came to deliver it.”</p><p>Benno blinked at the boy with wide eyes.</p><p>“My <em> what </em> now?!”</p><p>“Your daughter…? Did she not tell you? I… She commissioned it not long ago and told me to deliver it to you, I thought you knew, sir.”</p><p>“Boy, I’m a bachelor. I don’t know who you talked to, but not my daughter, that’s for sure.”</p><p>The boy looked at him with confusion, apparently taking a moment to gather himself before speaking up again.</p><p>“Oh… A niece, perhaps?”</p><p>“Do you mean my little sister? Do I look so old you’d think she’s my daughter?!”</p><p>“Oh, no, sir! It’s just that she looked very young! I- I thought she was just past her baptism…”</p><p>Once again, Benno was dumbfounded. Corinna was young and beautiful, sure, but there was no way anyone would mistake her to be a freshly baptised child. Was this boy trying to make a fool of him, or was there someone out there using his name to fool craftsmen? Was this perhaps a con to get him to pay for the order? Anger rose within him.</p><p>“Do you take me for a fool?! What do you think you’re doing, coming to my store, asking for me, trying to get me to pay for some made up order? Get out!”</p><p>The young blacksmith held the board protectively before him, like a shield. </p><p>“N-no, that’s not-! The-the order is already paid for, sir!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I am telling the truth, sir, I swear! The little miss came into the workshop not long ago and paid for the order. She said to contact you when it is done, sir. Look!”</p><p>The boy hastily handed the board over finally, and Benno begrudgingly read it.</p><hr /><p>
  <em> Gilberta Company, Benno </em>
</p><p>
  <em> When you receive this note, please contact me through the proper channels to arrange a meeting between myself and Johann. I wish to inspect the quality of the item personally. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> R.t.T. </em>
</p><hr /><p>R.t.T. …Surely not…</p><p>Benno groaned and put his head in his hands. He should have sent the boy away without meeting him first. If he never saw the board, he never would have gotten involved, right? But then again, that was just his logic, and it wasn’t like nobles ever really acted based on <em> his </em> logic. Heavens know this particular noble could be called many things, but predictable was not one of them.</p><p>“I take it you are Johann, then.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>The smith timidly answered. If he was getting this spooked by Benno, a merchant, losing his temper, he would not have an easy future interacting with the nobility. But he got his nerves together enough to follow up with a question. Benno wished the boy stayed scared, after hearing it.</p><p>“Is she… not a relative, then?”</p><p>A chill went down Benno’s spine.</p><p>“Never. Ever. Say that again. Someone might take it as an insult.”</p><p>“I did not mean to-”</p><p>Benno just waved him off. He’ll learn soon enough it did not matter what he meant.</p><p>“Tell me, kid. Whatever you were told to make – will she be satisfied with the quality?”</p><p>“Yes, sir! It has been made exactly as the little miss specified.”</p><p>Benno sighed. He was starting to feel like all he did these days was being stressed and sighing.</p><p>“Well, that’s a start… Alright, I guess there is no getting out of this mess now. I can at least prepare you for what’s to come.”</p><p>He picked up a bell on his desk and rang it, prompting Mark to enter the office again.</p><p>“You called, sir?”</p><p>Benno gestured Mark over, while continuing to talk to Johann. His conversation would serve to inform Mark of the context of his next request too.</p><p>“The ‘little miss’ who gave you the order. Was she about this tall, with dark blue hair, golden eyes and excellent manners?”</p><p>“Yes? So you do know her, sir?”</p><p>Benno pointed at the board.</p><p>“R.t.T. …Rozemyne Tochter Thorwaechter. The daughter of a prominent archnoble family. Our store happens to enjoy the patronage of the Lady, and just recently provided her with a dress suitable for a daughter of a wealthy merchant family at her request. Do I need to explain more?”</p><p>The smith had gone pale as a sheet and began to shake in fright. It seemed he got the message.</p><p>“A n-n-n-noble?”</p><p>“Not just a noble, kid, an <em> archnoble. </em> So let me ask you once again. Are you <em> sure </em> that she will be satisfied with whatever you made for her?”</p><p>The boy was still shaking, but gulped and slowly nodded at his question.</p><p>“Very well. Mark will teach you some polite language for speaking with nobles and how to conduct yourself if she summons you for a proper meeting as a noble with her entourage. It is in your best interest to make sure you do not offend her in any way. You might have just met either the best patron you could have, or the worst one, kid… In the meanwhile, it seems I have a letter to write.”</p><p>Mark placed parchment and ink on the table for him, before taking Johann to the side for an intense lesson in noble speech and manners. Benno sighed. Again.</p><hr /><p>It was bad enough deciphering the usual noble euphemisms of the answer. Figuring out that Lady Rozemyne wanted to have a meeting in five days’ time, in the Gilberta Company’s building, in her disguise, was a whole separate level of complicated. But here they were, kneeling in place, waiting for third bell to chime.</p><p>Benno had the good sense of arranging the meeting to be in his home, the second floor of the building, rather than the office where any employee could walk in. Mark led Lady Rozemyne in right on cue, pulled out a seat for her and poured a cup of tea before kneeling behind Benno to join in the greeting.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, we are pleased beyond words that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together and allowed us to meet once again. May this meeting, ordained by the divine guidance of the gods, be blessed by the God of Fire Leidenschaft on this vibrant summer day.”</p><p>“I bless this day from the bottom of my heart. You may stand.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne returned his greeting as was custom – surely a good sign. All three of them stood quite awkwardly in front of the young noble. It was still an odd feeling to be meeting her with none of her attendants present, as she was wearing a dress that Benno was sure no other noble would ever willingly put on.</p><p>“I was pleasantly surprised to hear Ordoschnelli sing the news of your completion of my order so fast, Johann. You have worked with exceptional speed.”</p><p>“I- yes. Thank you, uhm, Milady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne sighed and Benno immediately winced internally. Five days was just about enough to prepare the boy with enough manners that Benno didn’t have to worry about execution by association, but they were not expecting her to start making such casual conversation immediately. Including noble euphemisms too, no less.</p><p>“I see you have been informed of my status. I suppose that was unavoidable. This is fine for now, however as you can see, I am moving under Verbergen's shroud. When I am wearing this dress, I do not want it to be known that I am a noble, so outside of these walls, and especially in front of other people, you will treat me like a commoner. Understood?”</p><p>“Yes of course, Milady.”</p><p>Benno was the first to react, but the smith quickly nodded along with him too, not daring to speak without permission, and Mark crossed his arms and bowed his head in acceptance.</p><p>“Very good. Well, with that out of the way, Johann, do show me what you made for me.”</p><p>As they practiced, Johann handed a small box over to Mark, who placed it on the table in front of Lady Rozemyne, took off the lid, and touched each side of the small item inside. Lady Rozemyne produced an elaborately embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and used it to pick up the oddly shaped metal stick from the box. She looked at it closely, tilting it every which way in the light, but not touching it with her fingers, only the handkerchief. Finally, she placed her hand under the fabric, with the stick laying on top of it, and for a moment Benno could swear light flashed from the threads of the embroidery, but it was gone in a blink of an eye.</p><p>She did eventually pick up the stick with her hand, folding the handkerchief away, and held it between her fingers like one would a pen. It looked quite well proportioned to her hand, although Benno could not imagine how one would pick up ink with such a pen. But perhaps it was some noble thing. Regardless, after the thorough examination, finally a genuine smile bloomed on Lady Rozemyne’s face, and Benno could not stop himself from staring with wide eyes. It was so out-of-place.</p><p>“Excellent job, Johann! Vulcanift would smile upon your creation. You have exceeded my expectations, and they were quite high to begin with. You have passed my test with flying colours. I shall see to it that a workstation is created for you long term, and I’ll have a permanent contract written up for you as my exclusive.”</p><p>“T-Thank you so much, Milady! You honor me with your praise.”</p><p>The young blacksmith looked greatly relieved. And Benno could not really fault him for such a reaction, but as the boy bowed down, he saw a drop of nervous sweat hitting the floor. It seemed those lessons about possible consequences had stuck at least. But he would become an exclusive of the lady right away?</p><p>Benno would be lying if he said he was not even a little bit jealous of the young blacksmith. Becoming a exclusive to any noble and especially an <em> archnoble </em> practically assured your success and proved your skill for everyone to see.</p><p>“Sehweit has not graced me on the way commoners handle such a… special case. You see, Johann is no longer employed by any workshop, but will become my personal smith from now on.”</p><p>The young lady looked at him of all people as she spoke, making him tense up again.</p><p>“How would one deal with such a circumstance, I wonder…”</p><p>He wanted to groan and hold his head, but he just barely managed to keep his composure as he frantically thought about all the details he knew. The boy did his work for this order <em> somewhere</em>, right? If he was not working for the workshop, she must have already made some arrangements for him. It was a long shot, but he had to risk it to not seem incompetent…</p><p>“Ahem, Milady, please allow us to assist with the arrangements. If you wish, a new workshop could be built for your exclusive use, or perhaps an arrangement can be made with an existing workshop.”</p><p>“What a splendid idea. I’ll leave you to make arrangements with the workshop in my name. I suspect they will be receptive to the continuation of the previous contract. My servants, Gil and Fritz are still under Gustav’s tutelage, you may contact them for the required funds once an agreement is made with the workshop and Johann’s contract is created. They will be able to request the funds from my attendants. Oh, you may include your own expenses in the request.”</p><p>Finally, he said the right thing! The mention of an existing contract made him feel like the lady was testing him and he finally passed a test. To know that his efforts would be compensated felt like he was being rewarded for this test too. It was a weight off his shoulders. Surely, she was not so unhappy with him if she was rewarding his efforts.</p><p>A few more details were discussed, including how the smith would be paid a regular fee for his “living expenses” as the lady called it, but in exchange would only receive payment for the raw materials of any order she made. She certainly had some unusual ideas, but for a noble it was incredibly generous and considerate towards a commoner. Benno once again felt a pang of envy, as he was mostly just given more and more work with little consideration. But that was the life he chose, in the end.</p><p>Eventually, Johann was dismissed. The boy shakily said his farewell as Mark taught him and left with visible relief on his face. He hoped that would be the end of the meeting, but…</p><p>“Benno…”</p><p>He stiffened as Lady Rozemyne suddenly addressed him in a contemplative tone, her eyes drifting towards the top of his head.</p><p>“Your hair does not look any different at all. Did the rinsham I left for you and Corinna not have any effects? Or has it already worn off?”</p><p>He could feel panic rising in his chest, and he thought the room was suddenly too hot and too stuffy. He messed up. He locked the bottle carefully away as soon as he realised what it contained and didn’t so much as think about using it or giving some to Corinna. Lady Rozemyne was clearly expecting him to use it, and was now looking for him to report its effects, but he had nothing to show.</p><p>“Oh, I… My deepest apologies, Milady, it was such an incredible product that my sister and I wished to save it for a special occasion so that it is not wasted on our mundane lives. Something so rare, and crafted by yourself too, would be worthy of being passed down generations as a family heirloom. We couldn’t possibly use it so soon after you have so generously gifted it to us.”</p><p>How was it that he seemed to do nothing but take one misstep after another with this noble, when that young smith could interact with her twice and earn her approval? Benno was starting to feel that perhaps he was a terrible merchant after all and should not have been dealing with the nobility in the first place. Not that stopping was an option at this point… But Lady Rozemyne just waved his concerns off.</p><p>“Oh, nonsense. Who better to test a product in the first place than a merchant who might be selling it in the future? Things that are useful should be used.”</p><p>Benno was not quite sure if she was referring to the rinsham or him as useful things that should be used… But she continued without waiting for a response from him.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I am quite curious of the effects of the imbued blessings on commoners, especially women, so at least have Corinna use some of it. As long as I am satisfied with your work, it will not be the last gift of this kind you will receive.”</p><p>“Thank you kindly for your generosity, Milady. I will make sure that Corinna uses the rinsham at once so that I can report the effects to you at your convenience.”</p><p>That sounded almost reassuring, which immediately made Benno suspicious of a hidden threat. Of course, it sounded nice that they would receive such incredible gifts if she is satisfied. However, what does that imply would happen if she was <em> not </em> satisfied… Thankfully, this request seemed to mark the end of the meeting.</p><p>“I look forward to it, Benno. However, it appears Dregarnuhr has spun my thread with exceptional speed. I expect it will be some time before she will cross our threads again, as I expect to be quite occupied with celebrating Cuococalura and Grammaratur with the ladies of my faction, not to mention picking up Leidenschaft’s spear for Lord Wilfried. I shall summon you in my family’s estate if I am in need of the Gilberta Company’s service, as I likely will not be able to take on this disguise again for the time being. You may send the contracts to the estate when they are finalized. I will have a servant return them to you, signed.”</p><p>Benno dutifully nodded, and knelt to say the appropriate noble farewells as Lady Rozemyne stood to leave. Deciphering all that information was not easy, but if he picked up the meanings correctly, this nightmare of a lady just got a whole lot scarier. At least he would have some peace in his own home for a while. He did not look up until he heard the door close and the footsteps on the other side fade away. Finally, he let out the shaky breath he did not even realise he was holding, collected the small bottle of rinsham from a drawer in his desk, and practically sprinted up one more floor to barge into Corinna and Otto’s home.</p><p>“Benno, I know we are technically renting this floor from you, but you should still knock before you come in.”</p><p>Benno ignored the miffed Otto completely as he shouted in the general direction of the doors to other rooms in the home.</p><p>“Corinna! Noble business, come at once!”</p><p>It took a few moments until Corinna walked into the room, she looked at him in anticipation.</p><p>“Brother, what is it this time? Did the meeting with Lady Rozemyne not go well? Or does she have another order for us?”</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>He handed the bottle to his now confused looking sister.</p><p>“But this is…”</p><p>She clearly recognised it, but he gave her no room for questions.</p><p>“You need to go and wash your hair with it right now. She thought we had already used it and was asking me about the effects. She specifically asked you to try it, so go now!”</p><p>Corinna understood the implications of disappointing a noble all too well, and quickly hurried into the bedroom, telling Otto to bring a bucket of water for her before gently kicking him out of the room.</p><p>“So, uh… I take it that the noble business didn’t go well, then?”</p><p>Otto initiated some light conversation, his eyes glued firmly on the door separating him from his wife as if he thought he could see through it if he just tried enough.</p><p>“All things considered, aside from the mistake with the rinsham, it went quite well. But you don’t want to be making any mistakes when it comes to nobles…”</p><p>“Mhm, that’s for sure.”</p><p>Benno was fairly certain if he asked Otto what he just agreed with, he would not be able to answer. This was torture. But at least the torture did not last very long, as after a little more meaningless conversation, the door opened and Corinna poked her freshly washed head out into the living room. Her hair was still a bit damp, but the effect of the rinsham was still <em> very </em> noticeable. It was as if light moved around her differently. Her hair didn’t simply gain a new shine, it was also radiating something indescribable.</p><p>‘Heh. My sister is the most beautiful woman in the city. She is too good for Otto, but oh well…’</p><p>He couldn’t help but smile at his sister fondly as she called out to her husband sweetly.</p><p>“Otto? Can you come in here and take the water out for me, please?”</p><p>“Oh, I will <em> happily </em> go in there and do <em> anything </em> for you, my gorgeous, incredible wife.”</p><p>His sister returned a mischievous smile to him in response.</p><p>“Including taking the water out?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, I can take the water out after too.”</p><p>“That’s it, I’m leaving.”</p><p>Benno loudly announced as he got up and walked out just before the door to the bedroom closed behind Otto. He did <em> not </em>want to hear what followed, especially with the looks Otto was giving Corinna. He had his own observation of how the rinsham worked for the little devil in a lady’s body, and he prayed to every God and Goddess whose names he could remember that she would never get the opportunity to ask Otto about it.</p><hr /><p>“Master Benno, there is a messenger here for you.”</p><p>Benno eyed Mark in the doorway of his office.</p><p>“It’s not another craftsman for Lady Rozemyne, is it?”</p><p>It was already nearing the end of summer, and they have not heard of Lady Rozemyne in a while just as she said. But the smith incident still remained heavily on his mind, especially after having to do all the work of sorting out those contracts and dodging the questions of the curious workshop foreman.</p><p>“No, sir, it is from the Guildmaster. It appears a friend of his little granddaughter had some sort of… accident… at a tea party they were hosting, and urgently requires a new dress.”</p><p>Benno snorted. He had heard of this granddaughter before. Apparently, Freida was quite the force to reckon with. Maybe her guest wore a nicer dress than her and she decided to get rid of the problem with a strategically placed spill.</p><p>“Did the Guildmaster have any requirements aside from ‘urgent’?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. The messenger said the girl is probably close to coming of age, although a bit petite. Considering the dress is only a temporary measure for today, it should be a dress not too out of place in the north side of the city, but shouldn’t outshine the types of dresses the Guildmaster usually orders for his granddaughter. He asked for Mrs Corinna to accompany you, and has stated that cost is not an issue.”</p><p>“Well, well, well. It seems today is my lucky day to rid the old geezer of his money. Let Corinna know and send an apprentice to help her prepare whatever dress she wants to bring. You can tell the messenger we will leave in half a bell’s time.”</p><p>Benno always knew that his granddaughter was the Guildmaster’s weakness, but to think such an opportunity would fall into his hands… It was going to be a good day.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Her grandfather has always been overly concerned about her wellbeing, which was understandable, considering her condition. But ever since Lady Rozemyne took hold of her contract and tasked them with “cleaning up” merchants and craftsmen for her, he became even more overprotective. Grandfather was arranging meetings with her for the smallest movements Lady Rozemyne, or anyone on her list made. Freida liked hearing about the nobility, despite being somewhat terrified of the lady herself, but grandfather looking over her shoulder as she tried to manage the task given to her was rather tiresome.</p><p>Of course, she understood that the task may have been truly meant for her grandfather and she was simply used as the threat to ensure he would comply. She was not satisfied with that, though. It was her opportunity to establish herself as useful to someone powerful in her own right, without the influence of her grandfather. She was not a fool, she knew that if all she was good for was to control him, then as soon as he was out of the picture, she would once again be reduced to a mana womb. A wallet, in the best case. The thought alone sent a cold shiver down her back. That’s why she insisted on doing some of the work herself, no matter how much her grandfather despaired. She <em> had </em> to be more useful in other ways.</p><p>And so, after causing him all that worry, the least she could do was report to him and discuss her plans as often as he wanted her to, to settle his heart. He looked at her with a resigned expression after reading her latest report concerning the issue.</p><p>“With that, there are only two more remaining on the list Lady Rozemyne gave to us. Well done, Freida.”</p><p>“Thank you, Grandfather.”</p><p>The two remaining were Bernd, the Guildmaster of the Tailoring Guild, and Hans, Guildmaster of the Dyeing Guild. Everyone else was either ruined or “allied” to their family at this point, just as Lady Rozemyne ordered. But it was hard for Freida to not show her disgust at those two specifically. The list not only proved them to have made <em> extensive </em> use of poison in the past. But they uncovered Hans being involved with the former Mayor of Hasse, buying at least two of the orphans from there. Both of them young girls. And seeing as he was not married, it was obvious to her what his intentions were. Their potential fate hit a bit too close to her possible future to be comfortable. Freida not only wanted him removed from his position but to <em> destroy </em> this scum in full.</p><p>“I think we should focus our efforts on The Guildmaster of the Dyeing Guild first. He has the largest list of crimes we can prove anyway.”</p><p>Grandfather scowled at the mention of him. Ever since they dug deeper into those mentioned on the list, Hans stood out to them as the one with the most crimes. It was only because he was in such a prominent position that they had put him with Bernd as the last ones to deal with. She assumed the similarities felt uncomfortable to him as well.</p><p>The plan they had for dealing with the two scum was not that much different to their previous schemes. They were too well-established to be taken care of by simple sabotage leading to bankruptcy, so the next best option was to ensure they lost their noble patrons. Without connections to the nobility to protect them, there were plenty of people even within their own guilds who would have happily seen to it that they were gone for good. Of course, that was easier said than done. The plan included keeping tabs on the tasks given to these guilds by any noble patron, finding out which ones were directed at the guild masters specifically, and ensuring that these orders would not be fulfilled to an acceptable standard. They needed to move carefully, and more than anything, they needed time.</p><hr /><p>The end of summer was near. Freida could feel the sun’s blaze scorching her skin less and less each day, and the nights growing colder. Autumn and harvest would be near soon, bringing the time to make money from their food products. She could practically hear the coins hitting her purse already, making her sigh dreamily. She was assisting in the merchant guild, doing some apprentice work despite having her contract with a noble, to avoid suspicion. She usually entered through the main door of the guild to make sure she was seen by employees, but spent the rest of the day in her grandfather’s office, helping with the paperwork. This time he was on his way back from a mednoble’s estate on guild business, so she made herself comfortable in his chair at his desk as she worked.</p><p>Taking her grandfather’s spot in the office had two benefits. The obvious one is that she got to feel like she was in charge of such a successful company, which was her lifelong dream. The other benefit being that it seemed to really piss off her annoying brother, who was now sitting at her usual workstation.</p><p>“Do you have a list of all the food and supplies you’ll need when you get there? I have already budgeted for the trip. Grandfather insisted on two more guards, so I included them too.”</p><p>“Just the things I’ll need the first few days, until I learn about the local products and prices. I’ve learned enough about the climate to know what to look for though.”</p><p>Freida took the board Damien was handing to her. As she was in charge of the funds “confiscated” from the merchants and craftsmen on Lady Rozemyne’s list, she was keeping tight tabs on every coin in their possession that belonged to the lady. She would not dare touch any of it for anyone, including her own brother, if the move he was planning wasn’t under strict orders from the noble lady herself. Well, strictly speaking, Lady Rozemyne’s instructions included that she would be covering all expenses until the requested workshops were established in the new location, but that was exactly why she was meticulously documenting every single expense.</p><p>A noise suddenly caught her attention as she heard the door to the office open. She looked up in anticipation to see her grandfather returning, however, there was nobody standing in the door. She couldn’t even see anyone standing near the door in the waiting room on the outside.</p><p>“Dear brother, why don’t you go and close that door.”</p><p>“Don’t you always say you’re a big girl now, Freida? Go do it yourself.”</p><p>She hmpf’d at Damian’s response, but defeated, she got up from the Guildmaster seat and closed the door to the office. She heard the screeching of chairs behind her. She did not need to look to know what her brother was up to. So predictable. So she turned with all her limited stamina and took a big step back towards where she came from, and-</p><p>“Hello, Freida.”</p><p>
  <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/02da62192a32151ffd2be0468c18e6af/6a56879ac0bb5ecf-81/s1280x1920/c42d7933a12ace91945706618d482df92aa1dd55.pnj" alt="Rozemyne's face, very, very close" width="945" height="532" />
</p><p>She found herself face to face with Lady Rozemyne’s bright golden eyes right at her own eye level – she was certain the lady was taller than her – too close for comfort.</p><p>“Dregarnuhr has woven our threads in parallel for <em> far </em> too long.”</p><p>Freida slammed her hands over her mouth as fast as she could to muffle the scream she felt building in her throat. Her self control was enough to reduce it to only a small yelp. Her only consolation was that Damian seemed to be just as shocked at their sudden guest as she was, as he was now peeking at them from the floor behind grandfather’s table, at some point clearly falling off the chair he tried to claim.</p><p>She quickly fell to her knees and crossed her arms, not wanting to offend her any more than screaming in her face might have done. And based on the noises coming from the other side of the room, Damian was scrambling into the appropriate position too.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, may I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the vibrant summer rays of Leidenschaft, the God of Fire?”</p><p>“Oh? You may.”</p><p>“O Leidenschaft, may this meeting be blessed. I apologise for not being able to give a proper blessing, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>She was surprised at the feeling of warm mana reaching her as the lady granted her a blessing despite not receiving one herself. It was quite touching.</p><p>“I am impressed you have learned the noble greetings, Freida.”</p><p>She preened under the praise, but the lady’s attention was not on her for very long, as Damian made a ruckus at the desk. As she glanced over, it seemed he pulled some of the boards off the table as he was hanging onto the edge to look over to where Lady Rozemyne was standing while still kneeling behind the desk.</p><p>“Oh dear, are you alright there?”</p><p>“Ah, ehm, ah, yes! I apologise, Milady. I didn't mean to interrupt.”</p><p>Damian was flustered by the direct attention. Freida couldn’t blame him. This was his first time seeing a noble, and they had both grown up listening to grandfather’s warnings about how dangerous they were. Lady Rozemyne walked closer to him, making him shake as he knelt there, but her concerned look was replaced with something brighter once she got a good look at his face.</p><p>“Ah, Damian. How fortunate you are both here, I was expecting that Gustav would need to send for you. Although I see he is absent, instead.”</p><p>“Grandfather is on his way back from merchant business, Milady. He should be back shortly.”</p><p>Freida quickly answered the unspoken question, with a little dread building in her chest. Just what was it Lady Rozemyne wanted to discuss with grandfather that needed both her and her brother to be summoned?</p><p>“Ah, excellent. Let us sit and wait for him, then.”</p><p>A moment of awkwardness followed as Freida understood that this was permission for them to stand and take some of the lower ranking seats in the room, however thanks to her brother’s stupid move earlier to steal her spot in grandfather’s chair, he was now in the lady’s way. Thankfully, he at least had the presence of mind to quickly stand and pull the chair out for Lady Rozemyne, who sat down with such elegance it looked almost like she floated into the chair. Freida could not get enough of the sight.</p><p>There was a moment of silence before the lady threw a questioning glance at Damian, pointing at the boards still scattered on the floor.</p><p>“Are you not going to put them back in their place?”</p><p>Her brother paled slightly at the reprimand. Apparently he was now too nervous to even speak as he simply nodded before beginning to put them back on their grandfather's desk.</p><p>Freida had to suppress a wince at his embarrassing display, thankfully Lady Rozemyne simply sighed instead of saying anything else.</p><p>The ensuing silence was becoming highly uncomfortable, as Freida sat down at Damian’s earlier place.</p><p>“I see you have nearly finished organizing the necessary preparations for Damian’s mission. I do hope there were no complications requiring my notice?”</p><p>It spoke volumes of Lady Rozemyne’s opinion of her brother that she directed her question to Freida instead.</p><p>“Yes, all has been going well, Milady! Transport, food and guards for the journey have already been arranged. Many of the materials needed to establish the workshops you requested have already been bought and are already transported via some of our travelling merchant connections. Damian has been preparing a lot himself too.”</p><p>“Excellent job, Freida. How are your preparations going, then, Damian?”</p><p>Maybe she shouldn’t have brought him to the lady’s attention, on second thought, as he was once again so startled that he nearly knocked the boards he was arranging off the table again. Thankfully, he steadied his hands just in time to prevent disaster from happening and stepped back to stand on the side.</p><p>“It is going well, Milady. I-I have talked with many workshop owners to understand the process of establishing a workshop, and I have studied the region with grandfather and travelling merchants. I-I also talk with Gil and Fritz after their lessons, Milady!”</p><p>“I see you have been keeping busy. Good.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne smiled at Damian too, but Freida felt a little bit of satisfaction that he wasn’t praised as much as she was. She might as well use this chance to broach the topic she wanted confirmation on the most.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, may I ask a question?”</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“The boards before you contain the information on the profits gained from the individuals on the list you provided us. Then, the stack that my brother arranged so nicely for you on your right is the record of all expenditures for his move and preparations as you requested. I have taken the liberty to use these funds to cover the expenses on your behalf, of course everything is documented. Is… Is that alright?”</p><p>She tensed up, waiting for the answer or the reprimand, but before it could come, the door behind them finally opened, and the familiar voice put Freida a bit more at ease. Of course, the <em> words </em> the familiar voice spoke were not quite the right ones… But that was no longer Freida’s concern.</p><p>“Freida, I’m back! And I brought a pouch nice and full of coins you can count! Oh, Damian, you are here t-”</p><p>Grandfather’s eyes drifted from her over to Damian before quickly darting back to the figure he could see in between them. This was apparently a day for terrible behaviour in front of a noble. First, Freida nearly screaming in the face of the lady, then Damian dropping boards on the floor, and now grandfather essentially greeting all the commoners in the room before even addressing a noble. They really were quite lucky that Lady Rozemyne was so forgiving of their continuous mistakes.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne! My deepest apologies, I did not realise you wished to see me. I would have cancelled my meeting to ensure I do not keep you waiting!”</p><p>He quickly knelt and offered the lady a greeting as proper.</p><p>“May this meeting, ordained by the divine guidance of the gods, be blessed by the God of Fire Leidenschaft on this vibrant summer day.”</p><p>The merchant greeting. Just like that, Freida earned herself another acknowledging look from Lady Rozemyne while she returned the greeting to grandfather.</p><p>“I bless this day from the bottom of my heart. May the God of Fire Leidenschaft’s guidance take the Othmar Company to ever greater riches. You may stand, Gustav.”</p><p>“Thank you ever so much. I sincerely apologise if my grandchildren have not been sufficient hosts to you. They should have taken you to our meeting room that is much more suitable for receiving a noble.”</p><p>Her heart sank. Grandfather was right, she should have offered to guide Lady Rozemyne to the nice meeting room they established when she started working in the office! All the comfortable seating, the tea set and the small ornate table that used to be in grandfather’s office were moved to the new room to make space for her little workstation, and now only grandfather’s desk and nice chair, her own desk and chair, and one small stool remained.</p><p>“Oh, it is quite alright. I planned to meet you all in this office. As you see, I am in disguise and would prefer not to be treated like a noble outside of the walls of this office as long as I am wearing this dress.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne pointed to herself, and indeed, the lovely dress she wore was not at all suitable for a noble. It was similar in quality and design to the kinds of dresses Freida herself was used to wearing, just made for a slightly older looking girl. She didn’t notice the first time as it was such a normal dress for her, but it worked well to hide Lady Rozemyne’s noble status. Damian would have probably not guessed that she was a noble if Freida did not greet her and call her by her name.</p><p>“Besides, we were just having a conversation. Freida, to answer your question, that is perfectly fine. I shall send a servant to take the boards you prepared at a later time, and have someone look over the budgets to ensure all is well, but we can discuss that later. As we have already covered Damien’s preparations for his move, I would now like an update on your progress with the list I left.”</p><p>While Lady Rozemyne spoke, she indicated for grandfather to sit. With his chair being taken over by the highest ranked person in the room, he had no choice but to take the small stool, the only seat left. Damian was still standing near the desk, with his back against the wall, exactly where he stood after nearly knocking the boards over earlier. Grandfather being back must have given him enough courage to move again as he quickly made his way over to him, standing just behind him like an attendant. It would have been funny if it wasn't for the circumstances.</p><p>Freida and her grandfather then took turns explaining the events of the past year. How they gathered information on each of the individuals to decide their plan of action. How they took down any of the easy targets using the Guildmaster’s authority as an excuse to shut their businesses down. How they plotted to discredit the more established businesses, ensuring there was a successor who was not under suspicion for any workshop or merchant company that was important for Ehrenfest’s economy, or using competitors to drive out others from the market. They painted quite a nice picture of the progress they made, hoping that it would be enough to leave the lady satisfied despite the task not being complete yet. Finally, they informed her of their plans to deal with the final two on the list to assure her that they would not fail the task. They simply needed a little more time.</p><p>“Very well, do inform me when they are taken care of, or if any of your plans change. It would of course be preferable to know they were all out of my way and did not need me to <em> take care of them</em>, but winter is not approaching yet. Your progress is acc-”</p><p>There was a loud crash, and she saw some debris flying through the air, her head turning to the source of the sounds to her right by reflex. The window on the southside was smashed to pieces. Out of the corner of her eye she saw that their guest had vanished from her seat as well, the now empty place was not what caught her attention though. No. It was the hair raising screech of metal sliding along metal. She threw her head to the left, and the sight greeting her made her blood run cold.</p><p>Their noble guest was now standing, an unusually shaped sword in her hand holding back the blade of a more mature girl just inches away from cutting into Damian’s neck, two fingers of her other hand pointing at the throat of their attacker. Lady Rozemyne had just saved her dear brother from being decapitated by some unknown assailant!</p><p>Freida didn’t even have a moment to think about where the lady might have gotten her sword from before a heavy pressure filled the room, originating from her brother's savior.</p><p>“Down, girl.”</p><p>Two words. She only spoke those two words, but there was an authority behind them that made whoever heard them unable to disobey. Their assailant trembled before dropping her weapon and falling to her knees immediately. Freida was glad she was already seated, otherwise the power behind those words might have made her do the same.</p><p>She had thought that her grandfather had a commanding presence as the Merchant Guildmaster, but even her idealised image of him felt so tiny in comparison to what the lady before her exuded in this very moment. It was both captivating and terrifying. Her presence held so much weight that Freida felt as if it was physically weighing her down.</p><p>She stared at the girl with hair akin to a starry night sky, who looked like a perfect picture of the noble knights her grandfather had described to her in stories. She could barely breathe properly as she took in the sight, and she didn’t quite know what to do with herself. Part of her actually <em> wanted </em> to kneel down as well and relish the fact that she was bound to this lady by her contract, but it also felt just so wrong to move, when that presence, that pressure was holding everyone in the room captive.</p><p>“You still act without assessing the situation first. There was no need to attack my hosts, Angelica.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne knew their attacker?!</p><p>“Ah! I am so sorry, Milady! I just thought I was rescuing you from kidnappers. Please, forgive me!”</p><p>The blade in Lady Rozemyne’s hand shrunk rapidly in length, now resembling a dagger with an oversized grip.</p><p>“I will acknowledge that your speed and precision was near perfect. Your strike would have decapitated both of your targets, had I not intervened.”</p><p>Freida and her family's eyes widened, her grandfather and brother placed their hands on their necks protectively as they looked at the duo of blue haired girls in obvious fear and terror.</p><p>“But as usual, you did not look at the bigger picture before acting. Did you not see that they were merely hosting me? That we were having a civil conversation before your rude interruption? Do you truly think I could be captured and taken hostage by commoners against my will?”</p><p>“I- please, Milady. I didn't mean to-”</p><p>“You will be silent and listen to my scolding until I permit you to speak!”</p><p>Their attacker gave a strangled whimper as Lady Rozemyne interrupted them. They began to grovel at the imposing lady's feet. It was such a surreal sight.</p><p>“...On the other hand, nevermind. Your punishment can wait until we return back home. But be prepared for rough re-training sessions. If I have to beat spatial awareness and decision making into that pretty little head of yours, I will do so until it finally sticks! For now, simply take your usual place in guarding me, and keep your silence. Do you understand my orders, Angelica?”</p><p>“…Yes, Milady…”</p><p>The pressure finally abated, making it easy to breathe again. Their attacker, a pale-blue haired older girl, looked close to tears as she stood up, sheathing her weapon in a fluid motion. The now named Angelica then wordlessly moved to stand behind Lady Rozemyne as she retook her earlier place in her seat opposite of them. If Freida would not have been so terrified of the older girl nearly killing her brother and grandfather, she would have felt pity at the openly sad expression on her face!</p><p>“I apologize for my dear Angelica’s actions. It seems my personal guard knight was a bit… overeager. I will of course reimburse your family for the damages she caused.”</p><p>Grandfather’s eyes widened a little as he raised his hands in a placating gesture at the suggestion.</p><p>“There is no need for you to apologize at all, Milady. It was just a simple misunderstanding, I would never dare to demand compensation for such a trivial matter!”</p><p>Freida would have disagreed normally, but considering the leverage the lady held over them it was only natural to brush the repair cost under the rug. The fact that all of them were fumbling while entertaining her as their guest and insulting her practically without pause was most likely only fueling grandfather's desire to please the lady as much as possible. Said lady simply shook her head at the answer, making all of them tense up even more. Had they somehow erred <em> again? </em></p><p>“As much as I appreciate the gesture, Gustav. It is simply part of my Angelica’s punishment. The repair costs will come straight out of her salary. There is no need for you to worry.”</p><p>All of them relaxed a bit, but the whimper coming from Lady Angelica was kind of amusing. Freida should not have felt such vindication, but the action of the noble had nearly cost the lives of her brother and grandfather…</p><p>“Oh, speaking about you, Angelica…”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne glanced at her knight, the older noble girl visibly tensing up in anticipation, obviously preparing herself for even more scolding and additional punishments.</p><p>“As you can see now, I am here in disguise. There is no need for you to continue guarding me. You should return to the mansion and remain there until my return.”</p><p>To Freida’s great surprise, the older girl reacted to the dismissal by falling to her knees, assuming a… begging pose?</p><p>“P-Please no, Milady. Greifechan blessed me already by finding you. Please, do not send me away. I am your sword and shield. Please, give me a chance to be useful to you! It is your first trip outside of the mansion, aside from getting Schlageziel’s bounties, where I get the chance to guard you. It's much too cruel to take that away from me. I will surely receive a scolding when my parents discover the pay cut for my failings. Please, show me mercy!”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne appeared to be nonplussed, simply taking a beautiful stone out of her hip satchel. Freida notices that the piece held a soft glow, illuminating the lady’s hand. Was it a magic tool?</p><p>“Do you want me to evoke Gebordnung, Angelica? I already stated that I am moving under the covers of Verbergen. If I allow you to follow me around, it could tear my carefully crafted shroud, making the whole process pointless. In the best case, people would cover in fear seeing a noble prance around downtown, seeing me in garbs lacking of Kunstzeal’s divine gifts, mistaking me for one of your servants. Is <em> that </em> what you want, Angelica? To be seen as the one ruling the heavens?”</p><p>Freida would have never expected for a noble to be so expressive. It was not hard at all for her to see that the older girl was beginning to panic.</p><p>“W-What?! NO! Never, Milady! I only want to serve you! Is there truly no way? Please, have mercy and allow me the opportunity! If anyone can think of a solution, it is you!”</p><p>What a strange interaction this was to witness. Freida almost felt like she should not be privy to this. After all, this was putting a noble in a bad light, begging her lady to think for her. It was never a good idea to be involved with an upset noble. But whether they were getting involved or not was out of their control, as Lady Rozemyne turned to grandfather with a sigh.</p><p>“Gustav, it appears I am in need of a disguise for my guard knight. Send a messenger to the Gilberta company for me, I need Benno to bring a dress suitable for Angelica as soon as possible. Something that indicates lower status than myself, so it is not so much work to adjust to her. Ah, I suppose I will need Corinna to come as well to do the necessary adjustments. Can you arrange that?”</p><p>“Of course, my Lady. Leave it to me!”</p><hr /><p>While they waited, Freida brewed a cup of tea for both of their guests, took a demonstrative sip to show there was no poison, and they continued the conversation that was interrupted by the other lady’s arrival. Freida once again earned herself a compliment for being familiar with tea etiquette, and she was relieved all her studies were paying off so nicely.</p><p>Thankfully, they had plenty they could discuss until eventually a servant led Benno, Corinna and Mark into the room, the latter one carrying a couple folded dresses and a bag of supplies.</p><p>“You better be prepared to pay extra for dragging my ass here with no notice, you old geezer.”</p><p>“My my, Benno, I did not expect to hear such crude language from you. Did the messenger not inform you that cost was no issue?”</p><p>“L-Lady R-Rozemyne?”</p><p>Freida could have kicked her feet and giggled at the sight. Benno stormed in with an indignant look on his face, no doubt ready to request a disgusting amount of money from them. But his palling complexion when he noticed Lady Rozemyne sitting in the room was just too hilarious. It took all of her restraint to hold her composure. Lady Rozemyne simply took another peaceful sip of her tea while she stared at Benno. Getting the obvious clue, he and his companions kneeled before the lady, giving the expected merchant greeting.</p><p>“As you can no doubt infer from Gustav’s summon, I want to use your services once again, Benno. My dear Angelica is in need of a disguise. Seeing that you and your sister did such an excellent job crafting my own, I thought you suitable for the task.”</p><p>Benno for his part glanced nervously at Lady Angelica, whose expression spoke of wariness, hand on her weapon since they entered like they did. Freida would have been intimidated too had she not seen the very same lady begging on her knees just moments prior, and knowing that they would be safe from her blade as long as Lady Rozemyne did not want to see them harmed. Seeing how frazzled all of them were made her realize this was just another opportunity to prove her worth to her lady.</p><p>“Allow me to take care of the arrangements, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>She jumped into action, directing everyone as soon as she received the approving nod from the lady. She could feel the watchful eyes on her in the meanwhile and she belatedly realised that she volunteered herself for another test. But she would not be intimidated by it.</p><p>“Grandfather, Brother, <em> Benno</em>… A lady will be measured in here, men are not allowed to be present. Please leave the room immediately. Mister Mark, if you could place the supplies you brought for Mrs Corinna on the desk over here and then leave as well. Lady Angelica, would you kindly stand over here? Mrs Corinna, please come here as well. Is there anything else you need for your work?”</p><p>Lady Angelica looked to Lady Rozemyne for permission before allowing herself to be guided to the empty space in a corner of the office where a couch stood a mere weeks prior. The men did not protest being kicked out of the room, despite it being grandfather’s own office. She was not sure if they would simply wait outside the room or if perhaps grandfather would take them to the meeting room, but ultimately that was not her problem.</p><p>“Ah, no, I have brought everything I should need. Lady Angelica, may I measure you?”</p><p>“Angelica, place your weapon on the table here first and remove your armour. You will only need your bodysuit while we’re in disguise. I will hide your manablade myself, a schtappe transformation should be more than enough to guard me today.”</p><p>Freida watched with wide eyes as the armour the lady was wearing flashed with a soft light and melted away to form a simple stone in her hand instead. Her belt, with the sword she previously used to attack – which now somehow looked much shorter than when it was drawn – was laid on the table in front of Lady Rozemyne like an offering, and Lady Angelica permitted Mrs Corinna to measure her.</p><p>“May I remove your outer garments, Lady Angelica?”</p><p>After taking some of the simpler measurements, the seamstress made the request as there was no attendant present to help with the task. Freida was suddenly unsure if perhaps she should have left too after all the arrangements were made. After all, while she was bound to Lady Rozemyne by her contract, she was not anyone to Lady Angelica. She was clearly overstepping her place, being present in the room when the noble lady would be in a state of undress.</p><p>“Freida, would you refresh the tea and come join me?”</p><p>As if sensing her hesitation, Lady Rozemyne called her over, indirectly giving her permission to stay despite the happenings in the room. She quietly stood behind the lady in the position of an attendant, even if it was still far beyond her station. It felt nice to be included, as if she belonged there.</p><p>Mrs Corinna worked with incredible speed. She only needed to refresh the tea once more by the time Lady Angelica was wearing a still somewhat loose, but appropriate length dress, with the shoulders finally lining up nicely with her build. A few more stitches while the dress was on the lady inside out, before she was asked to strip again, and this time helped into the dress properly. It was not a perfect fit, but for the style of dress, which was intentionally a bit on the large side to allow for growth and movement, it looked like a dress a commoner girl of Lady Angelica’s build could own. All in all, it was quite impressive work.</p><p>“How does it feel, Lady Angelica?”</p><p>“It is a very useful dress. I feel like I could still fight as well as in my uniform in this. It is much better than tea party dresses. I would not mind wearing this instead of them.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne openly sighed at this response. Freida was becoming more and more puzzled by Lady Angelica. She acted so differently like she was told any noble would act. Bringing a commoner dress to a tea party among the nobility? The mere thought was ridiculous as it was dangerous. She did not even want to imagine what the consequences for the company supplying the dress would be should they be mentioned.</p><p>“Angelica, what are you saying… Corinna, thank you for your efforts. Freida, you can let the others know they may return. There is no need to hold us up any longer.”</p><p>As she expected, they were simply standing in the waiting room outside, Benno visibly more stressed than everyone else. He relaxed after returning to the room, seeing Corinna peacefully packing up her equipment, and Lady Angelica already back in her position behind Lady Rozemyne. Grandfather looked at the pair of ladies in pleasant surprise.</p><p>“Oh my, Lady Angelica, the dress works splendidly as a disguise for you. I am sure it will be no issue now if you accompany Lady Rozemyne as she commands.”</p><p>“Mrs Corinna is very skilled, grandfather! It was quite the experience watching her work. She was so fast and precise!”</p><p>Both Lady Angelica and Mrs Corinna straightened at the praise, the former smiling happily at her wish being granted, while the latter demurely shaking her head. But the most surprising was Lady Rozemyne’s reaction.</p><p>“Of course Corinna is skilled beyond expectation. She would not be my exclusive if she was not the best, just as there is a reason I did not only pick the Othmar Company to spread my trends, but Gilberta as well.”</p><p>There was no obvious kindness or praise in Lady Rozemyne’s voice. She simply stated these as facts, as if she was simply educating Freida on matters everyone else present would already know. But judging by the looks on the Gilberta Company representatives, this was in fact new information for them all. Most comical of them all was Benno, who seemed to go through the five stages of grief as he processed the information dropped on his head like a parue after midday.</p><p>Without much more discussion, Lady Rozemyne dismissed them all from the room, instructing her to arrange for the cost of the dress and the urgent delivery to be covered from the ledgers. It seemed her patience was finally beginning to run out. </p><p>“Where will we go next, Milady?”</p><p>Lady Angelica was quite eager now that she knew she would be allowed to guard her lady.</p><p>“Ah, I do not have many visits planned, however next I want to visit a workshop to see how my smith has settled in. The arrangements were made for me, after all, and I wish to ensure they are to my satisfaction.”</p><p>Her… smith? It was a bit strange to her that the lady would also employ a commoner by herself instead of through a workshop.</p><p>“Do you want to accompany us, Freida? I am sure it will be a good learning experience for your future tasks I will have for you.”</p><p>Freida’s heart beat slightly faster at this confirmation that she had proven herself useful enough to be given more tasks in the future. She would do her best to live up to <em> any </em> expectations of her lady. She ignored her grandfather's pale face before giving her confirmation.</p><p>“You honor me, Milady. I would be delighted to be included, should I call for a carriage to bring us to our destination?”</p><p>“Very well. Make the call and let us be off, then.”</p><p>She crossed her arms, as she saw attendants do before when given instructions, and quickly excused herself to call for a servant and prepare the carriage with haste. Lady Rozemyne and Lady Angelica followed after her shortly, thankfully just at the time when the carriage she used to travel pulled out in front of the Merchant Guild’s entrance. Lady Angelica helped her lady in first before entering herself, followed by Freida as the lowest in status. She could barely contain her excitement as they made their way to a part of the lower city she’d never been to before, accompanying two truly powerful ladies.</p><p>At that moment, she felt truly favoured by Griefechan.</p>

    <p>After her adventures in the lower city Rozemyne took a few days to <em> truly </em> relax in her chambers, hidden room or not. The fact that Angelica was able to pinpoint her usage of Verbergen’s blessing through the feeling of her mana surrounding her was as impressive as it was worrying. Rozemyne swore her to silence on her sneaking out of her home in secret by name, but it seemed much easier to simply include the maybe-not-so-air-headed girl in the future as an accomplice instead.</p><p>“Milady, you are planning to train with your father later today, right? Can I please accompany you when you are immersing yourself in Angriff’s blessing? Please?”</p><p>A quick look behind her showed that the girl she was currently thinking about was practically vibrating in excitement at the thought of watching her spar.</p><p>“…Honestly, why not? Let us depart for the gardens a little bit sooner. It does not make sense to start reading a new chapter if I have to stop so soon anyway.”</p><p>It hurt Rozemyne slightly to say this, but she had no desire to rob her father of his cherished time they spent together. Curiously, nearly all of her retainers decided to follow her from the beginning this time. Only Mathilde excused herself, citing that Mother wanted to speak with her about something. How curious. Rozemyne easily allowed her departure just before she was whisked away to be changed into her training attire by Lieseleta and Tuuliane.</p><p>As they arrived a bit earlier than usual, she had to wait a bit until her father arrived, giving Angelica the opportunity to speak.</p><p>“Milady, can I please participate too? Or even better, spar with you again? I trained <em> really </em> hard to not fall short of your expectations!”</p><p>In hindsight, Rozemyne should have expected this from her loyal knight. She was, as always, most interested in any matter in Angriff’s domain. It was hard not to smile at her.</p><p>“You are becoming more spoiled by the day, Sister! You need to learn that our Lady's lessons and wishes take priority before your own when you serve her. Stop being so needy!”</p><p>Angelica looked to the side with a pout after receiving Lieseleta’s harsh scolding. Was she trying to tempt Rozemyne to give her more headpats with her adorableness?! Wait, no. She had to interfere in their slight dispute.</p><p>“While I appreciate your willingness to scold your sister for her bad behavior, Lieseleta, please remember that Angelica is not only <em> my </em> retainer, but one who honored Gebordnung for me as well. She is not just your older sister anymore.”</p><p>The green-haired mednoble looked slightly embarrassed for the need to be reminded of this basic fact. Now both sisters looked away from her in a most adorable manner! That was just unfair!</p><p>“Please forgive me, Milady. I forgot my place and fell into old habits…”</p><p>“There was no harm done, and you were correct in your arguments, so I will excuse your eagerness this time. Please do remember to handle such matters more appropriately in the future. Angelica, your sister was correct. You need to prioritise my duties and desires before your own if you wish to remain in my service. Especially now that you have given your name to me.”</p><p>Rozemyne ignored that Angelica now looked like a kicked puppy. She had to show <em> some </em> sternness after all, or she would never learn. Their talk was interrupted when her father strolled into their meeting spot.</p><p>“Ah, my beloved daughter arrived early! And you brought nearly your whole retinue as well. Hmm. Say, Angelica, what do you think about sparing with my daughter? My dear Rozemyne needs more opportunities to fight against someone closer to her own age anyway. Seeing her trounce her seniors in the Knight’s Order tells me she still needs to learn how to show some restraint when battling those inferior to her.”</p><p>“Ah, Lord Guthfried. Nothing would make me happier, but…”</p><p>Angelica looked at her nervously while Rozemyne nearly looked at her father with a deadpan expression like the others around her did. Sadly, she had to have better control over her expression than that.</p><p>“Father… We just discussed that I should not spoil Angelica too much. Please do not contradict me when I just scolded her for her behavior.”</p><p>Her boisterous dad did not even try to look apologetic. He just threw a very non-noble smirk her way.</p><p>“Be that as it may, you really need to fight younger opponents, dear daughter of mine. When you enter the Royal Academy, you will face mostly feybeasts and foes around your own age. You cannot simply pummel other knights from duchies other than Ehrenfest like you are doing right now. I don't even want to imagine the potential headaches should you accidently go overboard against opponents from a duchy ranked higher than our own…”</p><p>Rozemyne carefully considered his words in her mind. It was true that she stood leagues ahead of everyone in her age group and beyond. Aside from Bonifatius, not even the adults were truly a match for her as far as she noticed. Which in itself was as sad as it was somewhat expected. Maybe he was right and she needed to learn how to hold back? What a ridiculous change of directions she now had to consider. She allowed herself to sigh openly before glancing at Angelica, who was still watching her with hope in her eyes. How could she honestly say no to such a look?</p><p>“Very well. If you insist, Father. Angelica, if you are still up for it, we can have a spar. I will try to learn to hold back as best as I can…”</p><p>“Yes! I would love to, Milady! Thank you so much, Lord Guthfried, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>Both of them moved a short distance away from the others, into an area specifically prepared for fighting. The compressed dirt there made it easier to use enhancement magic without fear of using too much force, and thereby sinking into the ground on accident. They took their places opposite of each other. Curiously, Angelica chose to wield her manablade, Ledelys, against her, instead of a training weapon. Rozemyne decided to humor her and returned the gesture by drawing her own manablade as well. The weapon felt comfortable in her hands as she adjusted her grip slightly. Hm, maybe she should think about naming her own manablade as well?</p><p>“Um, Milady. Would you be willing to use your song against me? The effect of it against Lord Bonifatius was so breathtaking to witness. It's been burned into my mind ever since. Please?”</p><p>The plea threw her slightly off guard. Rozemyne had been so focused on beating Bonifatius at the time, she had not even noticed anyone was watching them at all. What a blunder on her part.</p><p>“Oh my, I thought the whole exercise is to learn to show <em> restraint</em>. Your plea is defeating the purpose of this exercise, Angelica. Also, I was not aware you were watching us. Not to appear overly conceited, but are you sure about this? I do not want you to greet the Supreme Couple this early. Even my master was unable to fully defend against this attack without receiving injuries necessitating healing.”</p><p>Everyone except Angelica looked at her with strange looks, but she was more concentrated on her airheaded namesworn at the moment. Instead of being demotivated, she looked at her with even more motivation and awe. Oh dear.</p><p>“You are simply so amazing, Milady! I was not aware you were able to wound Lord Bonifatius as well as drive him back! How can I not desire to witness something amazing like your song and dance firsthand myself?! Oh! I recently got my full feystone armor, would you be willing to use your technique if I wear it for protection?”</p><p>Rozemyne was unsure. She had never tried her first battle song against fey-armor. The risk of killing someone was simply too great in training at that point, and she used her more refined songs instead of the prototype in real battle instead. On the other hand, she was much weaker right now, so maybe? She looked at her airheaded knight with a stern glare, making her tense up slightly. Good.</p><p>“As I mentioned before, it would seriously risk wounding or even sending you towards the towering staircase, Angelica. I do not want to demean you or your efforts to better serve me, I just do not think the risk is worth it at your current level of abilities. Also… do you think I did not notice that you avoided answering my question? This is supposed to teach me to show restraint…”</p><p>Rozemyne was slightly taken aback at the glint appearing in her knight’s eyes. She could not recognize its meaning. She was surprised that Angelica seemed to carefully choose her words as well. It was highly unusual.</p><p>“I… I know it could be taken as… um. Shameless? And that I am overstepping my place, but… But I just want to see the peak of what you can do, Milady! Just once! I beg of you, please show me your most beautiful tribute to Angriff!”</p><p>“…That would be meaningless. You will not be able to see it.”</p><p>Angelica’s eyes widened, a slightly hurt look on her face, before she steeled her expression, making place for determination instead.</p><p>“Milady, please give me a chance to prove myself! I trained so hard to serve you better! I may never beat you in a fight, but it is my duty to better myself to protect you to the best of my meagre ability!”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at her dad, unsure how she should handle this. To her great annoyance, he simply shrugged in response, still with that cocky grin on his face! Why was he so flimsy today?! She openly sighed. Again.</p><p>“Fine. But expect to receive even <em>harsher </em>training from me as punishment should you not live up to your boasting.”</p><p>Angelica paled, before her face regained her earlier determination. Rozemyne had to admit it only made her want to pat her head again…</p><p>“Get dressed in your full armor then.”</p><p>“Thank you so much, Milady! Just give me a moment.”</p><p>She questioned if it was truly proper for Angelica to change into her full armor right before their eyes, but being able to respond to any escalating threat so swiftly was mayhaps a good thing? She glanced at her retinue, who was just looking exasperated at Angelica’s antics like usual. At least her dad was politely looking away. As she looked at her knight again, she was hit with an uncomfortable sense of deja-vu by seeing Angelica in her full plate armor getup. The last time she had seen her like this was when… She shook her head to get rid of that though, there was no time to think about the past right now. </p><p>Taking a deep breath to center herself she closed her eyes briefly, concentrating on the song she was about to unleash. The one she already used against Bonifatius seemed the most fitting, seeing as it was the weakest in her arsenal.</p><p>*****</p><p>
  <em> ~Trapped in spirit to the earth~ </em>
</p><p>She released the tight leash on her mana, the feeling of freedom flowing through her, making her feel as light as a feather as she pushed the limits of enhancement magic most knights were aware of. It took her just a second to align the pulses of the freed energy to harmonize with the symphony of her singing. She opened her eyes.</p><p>
  <em> ~Where shadows find their due rebirth~ </em>
</p><p>The world around her became clearer, more focused, allowing her to see the minutest details in crystal clear quality. She could see the slightest movements of those around her, recognize how Angelica’s stance shifted just a bit, making her left leg twitch momentarily from the minor adjustment she made. She was most likely straining under the assault and oppressive weight of Rozemyne’s mana. One of the side effects of her unrefined first song was the crushing presence she exuded to all those around her after all. Rozemyne could feel her mentality shift accordingly as well – battle songs helped her to focus more on the present. The thrill of a fight. Minor inconveniences like <em> mercy </em> were secondary to being able to vanquish her foes as quickly and effectively as possible. Such emotions had no place on the battlefield. More time spent on one foe meant more potential losses for her side. Unacceptable.</p><p>
  <em> ~My blade has fallen but rises new~ </em>
</p><p>She coated her manablade with the aspects associated with Steifebriese. The blessing of the wind-subordinate coating her weapon with a barely recognizable layer of pale, nearly transparent yellow mana. The cutting winds of the Goddess of the Gale. But the more important aspect in her humble opinion was the boost in speed she gained – the world moved at a much slower pace in her eyes, as she charged in simple but graceful steps towards her opponent. The blessing of the Goddess made her body even more speedy than it was before. She was the blade in the wind, messenger of <em> death. </em></p><p>
  <em> ~The final blow will still strike true~ </em>
</p><p>A simple move of her wrist guided her enhanced blade to cut at the tendons of her victim's right leg as she passed, crippling their ability to respond to her moves. A spin brought her to the front again as she inflicted the same injury on the left, followed by an upwards strike at the wrist holding the blade. Not too strong as to sever the appendage from the body, but deep enough to assure disarmament of the weapon was guaranteed. Rozemyne took a moment to watch as her opponent began to drop to the ground as if their strings were cut, it was time for the finisher.</p><p>
  <em> ~A gift, a curse, but not my own~ </em>
</p><p>Another graceful spin gave Rozemyne the necessary force to cut through the piece of armor protecting the neck. This piece of the armor was always reinforced to prevent exactly what she was about to do. The feystone showed practically no resistance to her assault, much to her immense surprise, forcing her to reduce the range of the swing by angling her elbow inwards a bit. She had no desire to behead the girl currently enduring her onslaught after all. Her blade left a cut along the throat, not deep enough to kill, but more as a statement. As the overwhelmed medknight finished dropping to her knees, it was time to end her dance. She moved in position for the final blow of this match.</p><p>
  <em> ~A wish to guide this power home~ </em>
</p><p>Her opponent's lowered form allowed Rozemyne to stand comfortably as she thrusted her katana at the chest of her foe. Aiming a bit downwards was much easier than upwards. She easily pierced the armor and body below the place where the mana organ would be situated. She aimed with extreme focus, making sure there was still a considerable distance to the organ should she miscalculate, as unlikely as that would be, but the implied threat was sure to be delivered in any case. Rozemyne forcefully pulled the reins back on her mana, the minor backlash of her accelerated movements being negligible as the winds blew slightly outwards of her body like a shockwave. The gale pushed her hair away from her body before it settled back into its original place.</p><p>“Hurgh!”</p><p>She looked down at Angelica’s face, her anxious, if confident expression making place for a pained grimace as blood spewed from her mouth. She allowed her overconfident knight a short moment. Her muscles twitched as she forcefully suppressed her instincts to move her weapon as Angelica shakingly grasped at the blade still piercing her chest. The pale-blue haired knight’s eyes widened as the full scope and speed of her defeat seemed to hit her like the Goddess whose power Rozemyne had just used to defeat her. She put a finger on her knight's throat, making Angelica flinch slightly from the contact as she used her mana to forcefully close the cut she inflicted earlier.</p><p>“Would this have been a real fight, I would have cut your head off. Trusting in your armor is a valid tactic, but you must always consider that the weapon of your opponent may be able to surpass it like mine did. Knowing that you are facing an archnoble as a mednoble should have made you more cautious. A shallow cut should serve as a fine warning to remember this lesson.”</p><p>Rozemyne moved her left foot to lightly tap the right knee of her opponent.</p><p>“Your ability to move was disabled by the cuts at your legs, removing your chances to react. For good measure I also cut your wrist to disarm you. Severing them all from your body was possible, and would be the preferred outcome if you were facing a true enemy. It may take a bit more force and mana, but the morale shock of seeing this much blood can be useful in some cases as well. If you are advanced enough, it can even be used as cover to conceal your next move.”</p><p>She placed her hand on the cheek of her trembling knight after finishing sealing the cut, those blue eyes taking on that unreadable look again. Was it fear? No. She was more than familiar with the aura of those cowering before her. This was something different, if similarly raw in nature. It was slightly confusing.</p><p>“I pierced your chest just below your mana organ. Should you be able to hit said organ, do so. It is the most effective way of eliminating your opponent, if there is no need for interrogation or the throat is not an option, of course. The only thing preventing you from bleeding out right now is my blade still remaining in you.”</p><p>She could feel Angelica’s armored fingers strengthening her grip on the blade by reflex, most likely to prevent its removal on sheer instinct after listening to her. Rozemyne leaned closer to whisper into Angelica’s ear.</p><p>“Do you regret offering your name to me? This is only the beginning of what I am capable of. I could have killed you as easily as I breathe, in a multitude of ways, in fact. Tell me, Angelica. Not by your name, duty or whatever else motivates you. But on your first brush with your own death. Do you <em> fear </em> your own demise? Are you <em> afraid </em> of me now?”</p><p>“Never!!!”</p><p>The sheer zeal surprised Rozemyne, as was the strength of the grip on her blade. As she leaned back again to thoroughly inspect Angelica’s face.</p><p>“I could never fear you! The only reason I would fear death is because it would prevent me from continuing serving you, Milady. I… apologize for underestimating the depths separating us. Your beauty truly knows no bounds!”</p><p>“…You are losing too much blood by speaking so much. I will remove my blade now. It will be painful. Grit your teeth to not bite your tongue. I will heal you right after I pull it out.”</p><p>Rozemyne received a shaky nod, beginning her prayer to Flutrane and Heilschmerz before retrieving her weapon, just as she spoke the last words. Unsurprisingly, the rest of the sparing time was canceled, and she was sat down for a <em> long </em> scolding by her father. She did not protest. It was fully deserved as she <em> did </em> go completely overboard. But she preferred to stomp overconfidence in her airheaded knight out sooner rather than later. Having too much confidence in her armor was exactly what had killed her before. To her great surprise, she received no wary looks from her retainers, which was a bit odd. She had honestly expected some sort of negative reaction like fear from them as well. The only slightly concerning fact was that Angelica seemed to be sending nervous looks at Lieseleta instead of herself, who was in turn giving her sister the cold shoulder. Rozemyne could not restrain her curiosity.</p><p>“Angelica, Lieseleta, is there something wrong?”</p><p>“Ah, It is just that–”</p><p>Before Angelica could answer, she received a devastating look from Lieseleta, making her shut up.</p><p>“Please do not mind my foolish sister, Milady. She has to learn to deal with the consequences of her actions on her own.”</p><p>“Indeed, Master of my Master. My Master’s sister is correct in her assertion.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked between the two, but apparently Angelica was so cowed by her sister and sword double-teaming her that she did not speak up for the rest of the day if she could avoid it. Rozemyne decided to not prod the issue again for now at least.</p><hr /><p>Rozemyne was annoyed. Dealing with the constant “requests” of Klassenberg for her to take a second consort from them was just so… <em> Ugh!</em> Oh, how dearly she wished she could simply erase their duchy with her Grutrissheit, but she had no real time or room for the internal conflict it would doubtlessly cause, when she was already fighting a war for Yurgenschmidt’s very survival. Did they truly not have anything better to do than squabble amongst themselves while the whole country was embroiled in conflict?! Maybe she should just put her foot down at the next best opportunity and make an example? She put the magic letter stating their request down with a huff.</p><p>“Another request from Klassenberg to take a second consort candidate?”</p><p>Rozemyne turned her head in the direction of the voice, a slight pulse of her mana turning the earlier darkness into the now familiar grey of her new ‘vision’. This new technique of hers was still not perfected, it only enabled her to see a few meters in clarity before it all became a jumbled mess of shades. At least it was not hard to recognize the voice at this point. It sounded just as annoyed as she felt herself.</p><p>“Klassenberg’s Archducal family is most <em> eager </em> to confirm their previous standing after my ascension. Falling to third place in the rankings behind Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel seems to bother them quite a bit more than I expected.”</p><p>“What <em> did </em> you expect from them? They dominated the first place among the ranks for <em> years. </em> And now they suddenly lost it after you became the rightful Zent by wielding the Grutrissheit and the combined backing of Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel. Taking me as your future first consort as well is bound to hurt their overblown pride. As if they have anyone worthy to offer to you… What a sad farce. Did they not hear that the Ditter bell has already rung? Angriff will not pause in his steps because these fools pretending to be Liebeskhilfe demand so.”</p><p>Rozemyne could only sigh after hearing that speech. Unsurprisingly it was Hannelore who chided him in her stead.</p><p>“Brother, please watch your tone…”</p><p>“Why should I, Sister? Did they not also offer you to become the first wife of that slimy douche Hensfen as well? The sheer gall of them! Verbergen shields us, so let me vent a little bit for that insult from those weaklings!”</p><p>The three of them were currently under a sound-blocking magic tool in her office as Zent. Hannelore standing behind her as her guard knight together with Heisshitze, who was most likely internally laughing at their conversation. The rest of their respective entourages spread out around them as they discussed the results of the first day of the Archduke Conference under her reign.</p><p>“I refused the offer, and Gebordnung was my witness as I swore to become Leidenschaft of my chosen Lady. You know this already.”</p><p>“Still, they should–”</p><p>“Enough. That is talk for later, Hannelore and myself are still underage right now. I promised you to bind our stars already, there is no need to feel insecure about the whole affair, Lestilaut.”</p><p>Rozemyne interrupted their slight spat before it could escalate. And, seeing the current atmosphere, she dissolved the meeting for the day. They had cleared every important point for today anyway. She bade Lestilaut farewell, giving his hands a subtle squeeze of reassurance and made her way back to her own villa. Rozemyne still found the practice of living in different palaces so tiresome she would tear them down as soon as this crisis gave her a little bit of room to breathe. At least her dear Hannelore was allowed inside with her as her knight, so it was not a complete loss. </p><p>As she strode along the halls, she pulsed her mana regularly, the grey world beginning to be her constant companion since she lost the vision of her eyes. All of them had just passed a corner when she was suddenly pushed back by an arm. There was a soft sound of something moving at high speed then piercing something metalic where her head would have been, making her aware she had just been saved from her likely demise. Her guard knights formed a defensive perimeter around her and her group of attendants and scholars.</p><p>“Assassins!”</p><p>Rozemyne put more mana than usual in her next pulse, revealing a vast group of mana cores charging at their position at speed. If her first impression of the size of their cores was right, at least half of them were archnobles. Several small lines of mana flew at them. Mana-projectiles, arrows maybe? A second pulse revealed that they seemed to have been reflected by the shields of her knights, only the figure with a pale blue core pulling a projectile out of their arm. Her savior? Angelica. Shortly after pulling it out, she dropped to her knees, convulsing on the floor, a pained gasp reaching Rozemyne’s ears.</p><p>“Damn it, those are poisoned?”</p><p>Cornelius’ murmur pulled her out of her short visit to Schlaftraum’s realm. How dare they?! They dared to attack her in her own home? Hurt <em>her </em> dear retainers? They would pay!</p><p>She unshackled her mana with the next pulse.</p><p>“M-Milady?”</p><p>She ignored Gretia while the attackers dropped to the ground, her Crushing affecting everyone not being gifted one of the talismans containing her mana, which was just her carefully selected entourage surrounding her at the moment. Those <em> vermin </em> did not even deserve one of her battle songs. She would simply crush them under the weight of her mana alone!</p><p>“Secure them. Leonore, which duchy do they belong to?</p><p>“They wear the colors of Jossbrenner, my Lady.”</p><p>Rozemyne had feared that it was some of their own. The fact she could see their cores had confirmed that they were Yurgenschmidt born. But Jossbrenner? For that duchy to so openly oppose, and even dare attacking her… Klassenberg had to be involved somehow. Oh, she would relish in <em> destroying </em>them for this! But there was a more important matter to handle right now. She reigned her power back in, the state of her assailants’ cores indicated that all of them were either unconscious or climbing the towering staircase. She turned her attention to Angelica, the sight greeting her nearly made her recoil.</p><p>The once cheery blue core was now a dark grey, black vines strangling it into submission as the color became darker and darker. Rozemyne was at her side in an instant, but her prayer to Flutrane and Heilschmerz showed no results, much to her growing distress.</p><p>“We gave her a general antidote, but it does not seem to be working. I am sorry, Zent.”</p><p>Heisshitze’s comment was not lowering her mounting distress at all!</p><p>“My… Lady…”</p><p>She ignored everyone around her, kneeling down to cradle the head of the figure that was Angelica in her lap, taking her hand into her own.</p><p>“Angelica, please hold on! We will–”</p><p>“It’s… no use. I… can’t see… anymore. Ah… so that… is… the world… you… live in… now. So dark… I wish… I could have… brought… you… light.”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced at the core, holding back a sob. The black veins covered nearly the entire structure now. Please no! She placed one hand on Angelica’s cheek, it was becoming cold!</p><p>“I… glad… to… <em> finally</em>… been… use… to you…”</p><p>Rozemyne felt a lone tear leaving her airheaded knight's eye. Her facial muscles indicated that Angelica was smiling at her. Smiling!</p><p>She could no longer hear her breathing, the core having turned a dark black. She was… She was–</p><p>“No. No no no no! N-”</p><hr /><p>“-O!!!”</p><p>“Milady, what is wrong?! Are you alright?!”</p><p>Her heart beat a mile a minute, cold sweat pouring out of her body, slightly drenching her… nightgown? Her eyes gazed around her, taking in the luxurious veils of her bed, the soft mattress she was currently resting in, how her shaking hands had her covers in a deathgrip. Right. She could see again. Her bed. A nightmare?</p><p>The soft metallic screech of a blade being freed from its sheath made her tense up, she nearly unleashed her mana in fright, but it was just her loyal… knight… searching for an invisible foe to save her. Again.</p><p>“A-Angelica?”</p><p>“Yes, Milady?!”</p><p>Right. Angelica was still alive now. She could change things. <em> Would </em> change things! That was why she agreed to be sent back, after all. So that everyone she cherished could come back, could be saved, could live… Still, she could not stop her pathetic shaking, it had felt so, <em> so </em> real…</p><p>“An- gelica Hi- Hidd- …<em> hic </em>… den ro-”</p><p>Rozemyne didn’t even need to finish her stuttering sentence between her sobbing. Her loyal knight didn’t waste a moment before re-sheathing her weapon and pulling her up into her own arms. The position made the cold feeling go away a bit as she was carried to the entrance of her hidden room. She allowed her hand to be stretched out, her fluctuating mana pouring into the door as it opened. She was placed into her comfortable chair, the warmth receding again as Angelica stepped away, attempting to give her space. Before she could protest, a hand gently took hold of her own, something cold being pressed against her forehead. Her fluctuating mana was siphoned away, and she felt the cold object turn into dust. Ah, it was a feystone.</p><p>“Milady, it was just a nightmare. There is no need to fret, everything is alright. Please try to take a deep breath. You are safe.”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced up, recognizing Mathilde as she fretted about her. It warmed her a tiny bit to be fussed over, but it was not enough for her jumbled mind.</p><p>“Ma- Ma- de. Mo- mom.”</p><p>“At once, Milady.”</p><p>Tears made it hard to see what was going on right now, but she heard steps going away. A short, muffled conversation took place before the door to the room closed softly. She used her sleeves to stop the flood of tears a little, and took a moment to look around the room. It was just her and Angelica right now, her clueless knight looking at her with open worry. Rozemyne stretched her arms out.</p><p>“Hug.”</p><p>She was pulled from her seat again, into the warm embrace of the older girl, who had the mind to remove her armor first. It was warm, soft. She swung her trembling arms around her personal knight. The one who had sacrificed herself to protect her in her past. After a few moments, she felt hesitant pats on her back, before a hand began to stroke her hair. She felt her legs touching something soft, had Angelica sat down? No, that was irrelevant right now. It was just so comfortable, causing her arms to stop shaking as she buried her face deeper into the chest of her still living pillar.</p><p>“O' Leidenschaft, God of Fire, Flutrane, Goddess of Water, Schutzaria, Goddess of Wind, Angriff, God of War, Heilschmerz, Goddess of Healing, Greifechan, Goddess of Fortune, Dauerleben, God of Longevity, please grant your blessing and protection to Angelica, to my loyal knight, to–”</p><p>She could not bring herself to say the thoughts that spilled into her head.</p><p>‘To the one who died in my arms.’</p><p>“–to my first pillar.”</p><p>She finished the whispered prayer with simple words, keeping her true thoughts deep in her heart, and allowing the blessing to take the remaining of her turbulent mana.</p><p>“Milady, that was so beautiful. But why the sudden blessing for me?”</p><p>“…I am so sorry…”</p><p>“What? Why, Milady? I am honored to receive it. There is no need to apologize to me!”</p><p>“…For wounding you like this in our fight earlier.”</p><p>She regretted it now. Why did she even go overboard like this? To prove a point?</p><p>“For nearly k-killing you.”</p><p>What was wrong with her? She willingly took the risk of killing Angelica herself. It was true that she was in full control, but the risk was still there.</p><p>“For making you take care of me like this.”</p><p>Did she not swear to herself to not be such a pathetic burden to everyone around her anymore?</p><p>“I… I f-failed you so much in the past.”</p><p>And not only her, but everyone she cherished… Could she even be forgiven for her actions?</p><p>Silence.</p><p>There was no reply, making her slightly anxious if she had destroyed their relationship.</p><p>No.</p><p>She deserved as much. She was not surprised when Angelica let go of her. But suddenly the girl took hold of her face with both hands, staring into her eyes with that emotion she could not decipher again.</p><p>“Please do not apologize to me, Milady. I will <em>always</em> serve you.”</p><p>Of course she would. In her greed, Rozemyne had bound her very name to herself. Just to feel better.</p><p>“…Do you not regret giving your name to someone as pathetic as me? I can return it if you–”</p><p>“No! Um, I mean please no, Milady. You are not pathetic at all. You are my master. The most breathtaking lady I have ever seen. I will never regret giving my name to you. Being able to serve you is simply the best!”</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes again, causing Angelica to let go of Rozemyne’s face and firmly pull her back into a warm embrace.</p><p>“But my naivety and foolishness caused you to die in the pa–”</p><p>The petting of her head resumed as Angelica gave her a big squeeze just after, making Rozemyne halt in surprise.</p><p>“Please do not worry, Milady. I will gladly give my life for you whenever you want me to. It would be my greatest honor to pro–”</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>It was her turn to grip Angelica with more force, eliciting a startled yelp. Right, she was using enhancement subconsciously. She forced herself to relax her grip a bit.</p><p>“Please don’t die for me again! You’re mine! <em> Mine</em><em>!</em> I <em>order you</em> not to die! Please don’t leave me!!! I can’t… Please don’t–”</p><p>“Then I will simply serve you forever, my Lady! I will stay by your side as your pillar for as long as you want me to.”</p><p>“…Promise?”</p><p>“Yes. I promise.”</p><p>She cuddled deeper into Angelica’s embrace in silence. The hug calmed her down a lot, but she still needed a distraction.</p><p>“...What was the reason for Lieseleta scolding you earlier?”</p><p>“Oh, that was because… Um. I mean, I really should not burden you with my issues, Milady.”</p><p>She pinched the older girl in her side, eliciting another startled sound.</p><p>“As if that ever stopped you.”</p><p>“I am so sorry!”</p><p>“You should, but I do not mind it, really. I know you dislike thinking about things, so let me do the thinking and tell me what troubles my pillar.”</p><p>Angelica gave her another squeeze before explaining that her parents were most exasperated with her for angering Rozemyne to the degree she was punished with a pay-cut. Things got even worse when she ruined Angelica’s brand new armor, which did not come cheap, apparently.</p><p>“So now you are essentially about to lose your savings because you need to hire someone to repair your plate armor by yourself?”</p><p>“Yes. I can't leave it in disrepair like it is, it would lower my ability to guard you. That’s unacceptable!”</p><p>She hummed in thought. So the main issue was the destroyed armor? She could fix that.</p><p>“Does it necessarily need to be repaired? Could you not acquire a new one?”</p><p>“B-But that would be even more expensive, Milady. Even my family cannot purchase one all the time, especially not me alone!”</p><p>Were they that expensive? She had no reference for this at all. She had simply been given one, or crafted it herself later.</p><p>“I can give you one, you know? It was me who destroyed it in the first place…”</p><p>“I could never accept something that valuable as a present, Milady! And the potential debt… I shudder at the scolding I will get for this.”</p><p>Ah, it seemed Angelica misunderstood her.</p><p>“No, I meant that I will craft you one myself. I have read how to do it in a book just recently.”</p><p>She was pulled once more from the embrace. Angelica placed both of her hands on her shoulders as she stared at her with a look resembling awe?</p><p>“You would brew one for me <em> yourself? </em> With your own mana?!”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>It seemed to be a bigger deal than she would have thought, Angelica began to openly cry before pushing Rozemyne’s head into her chest, thanking her over and over… The hug was very nice, but now she felt even more guilt that she had destroyed her old armor.</p><p>“Oh. When can you do it, Milady? Should I–”</p><p>“Oh my, do you even still need my attention, dear daughter of mine?”</p><p>The moment was interrupted when her mother walked into the room, Roselinde had an impish grin on her lips as she watched her being pushed into her knight's body. </p><p>“Ah! I am so sor-”</p><p>“Yes, Mother. I would be delighted if you would find it possible to give me a hug instead of my pillar. She did an excellent job, but it is not the same as receiving the loving attention of my Wiegenmilch.”</p><p>Rozemyne decided to intervene before Angelica said something embarrassing again.</p><p>“It seems your gift from Grammaratur has returned to you as well. And here I was, hurrying to you as fast as I could. I feel cheated by your knight now.”</p><p>She felt Angelica tense up. She gave her a reassuring squeeze in return. It seemed to work as she felt her knight relax.</p><p>“Please do not bully my Angelica. She did a marvelous job calming me down.”</p><p>Rozemyne freed herself from the embrace, looking at her mother before opening her arms. The signs of her crying must have been still visible, as her mother lost her amused grin. She was lifted up into another embrace, one she had no scruple enjoying as much as possible. Not that Angelica gave bad hugs, but comparing it to her mother’s was just unfair.</p><p>She shamelessly rested her head on her mom's bosom, using the plentiful cushioning to get as much comfort as possible as she closed her eyes. There was really something going on with either her mind or body, as the humming of Roselinde should not have had such a calming effect on an adult trapped in a child's body. Maybe it was because she was a child again? Was there more to it than simply a smaller body? She would have to think about the implications later, they could become a very big problem in the future.</p><p>“Um, should I leave?”</p><p>She opened her eyes at the question, glancing at her dear pillar glancing nervously at the open intimacy.</p><p>“No. Be a good girl and stay where you are. I want you to guard us until I am fit to return.”</p><p>“Yes. Thank you, Milady!”</p><p>She snuggled a bit more with her mom, who seemed to relish in the opportunity to hold her as well. She truly had the best parents imaginable, be they commoners or nobles. Rozemyne had mostly calmed down at that point. In hindsight it was kind of pathetic that she overreacted with a full-blown panic attack just because of a nightmare, however realistic it was.</p><hr /><p>After Rozemyne and Roselinde had had their fill of lovely hugs, all three of them returned back to her room, where she had to apologize to her other retainers for the unsightly display. At least they seemed to simply find it adorable… What could be adorable about having a panic attack eluded her, but she simply chose to accept it. She realised belatedly that still being carried in her mother’s arms did not help her with projecting a mature image at all. While all of them were fussing about her, she spied Hisui hopping on her bed, seemingly taking something into her mouth?</p><p>Rozemyne was distracted as Mathilde told her that her schedule was now a mess, and she would lose some of her reading time to compensate. Damn it! She put her right hand on her face in a perfect Angelica pose. Just when she was about to protest, her mother spoke up again.</p><p>“Dear, where did you put your children-tool? Do not tell me you took it off in your sleep.”</p><p>Rozemyne blinked, looking at her wrist where the bracelet stayed normally, confirming its absence. She was sure she had worn it when turning into bed. Maybe she had destroyed it because of her rampaging mana in her sleep? The nightmare was pretty intense after all. Wait…</p><p>Rozemyne turned her head towards her bed, just as a sudden light nearly blinded her, causing her to shield her eyes to protect them. There were some shouts of surprise, Angelica stepping before her mom to shield them both with her body, until the light diminished to a soft glow that receded just as fast. What she saw next made her eyes go wide, she nearly cursed.</p><p>‘Oh, come on!’</p>

    <p>Everyone stared in disbelief at the scene before them. It should have been a familiar sight, paws resting on the duvet, a little fluffy tail dangling off the bed and a small lump of midnight blue fur piled on in the middle. Except this time the “small lump” took up about half the bed, probably bigger than little Myne would have been at this age in the last weave. Large paws pressed deep into the duvet, sinking from the weight, and the tail hanging off the bed was brushing the floor in small circles.</p><p>Lounging on her bed was Hisui, or more accurately, a grown-up version of her cute little pet. This evolution of the feybeast was called a fetze, if Rozemyne remembered correctly. But how, and why had she evolved at this very moment? On her bed no less…</p><p>She stopped in her tracks to glance at her now bare wrist, where her children's tool had stayed previously. The memory of Hisui taking something in her mouth before she was distracted sprung to mind.</p><p>‘Did Hisui eat my children’s-tool? Or somehow absorb my rampaging mana from it? That would explain her sudden evolution…’</p><p>“Mreow.”</p><p>Everyone tensed up when her formerly cute, now quite intimidating little pet looked at her. That sounded a lot deeper and more mature than her previous little mews. She wondered if her personality had remained the same, despite the obvious physical changes she went through in her evolution.</p><p>“Hisui…”</p><p>She tried to put as much disappointment into her tone as possible, looking sternly at the grown-up feybeast.</p><p>“Mreoow…”</p><p>The fetze lowered its body to lay on her bed, the ears on her head flattened like she always did when she was chastised. The reaction dissolved the previous tension somewhat as everyone realized that her adorable furry friend had only changed in body, not in character or acknowledgement of its master. Using the moment, Rozemyne indicated to her mom to be let down from her embrace. After she stood on her own feet, she boldly approached the former zantze, petting its head for a few moments. The treatment seemed to greatly please her sweet pet as usual, her enjoyment being all too obvious as she closed her eyes in bliss, beginning to purr. </p><p>The purring reverberated along her arm, up to her chest where the feeling hit her much harder than she expected. As if she could <em> feel </em>Hisui’s happiness in her own <em>soul</em>. It was quite unusual… She took Hisui’s head in her hands, pulling her little face up to her own to inspect her pet more intensely. Hisui’s eyes opened again to look at her curiously, probably wondering why she had stopped. Rozemyne noticed that her right eye was now golden instead of green, and upon closer inspection her fur seemed a little bit darker as well, now being nearly indistinguishable from her own hair coloring.</p><p>"How interesting. It seems you have grown up well, Hisui. You clearly remember who your master is. What a good girl you are.” </p><p>“Mreowow!” </p><p>‘I wonder where that sudden feeling of happiness is coming from…’</p><p>She simply gave Hisui another pat on the head, making the feeling grow slightly as she continued to spoil her pet. It really was like her own feelings were resonating with Hisui’s. Was there maybe some sort of emotional link between them now? It was something she had to take note of and study more thoroughly… Later. She still had a full day ahead of her.</p><p>She tried to act nonchalant and suggested starting the usual morning preparations, which, surprisingly, everyone simply agreed to with no complaints. Even her mom simply gave her a head pat before leaving the room with her attendant to get ready herself. Being dressed in her riding dress was kind of uneventful, aside from some small comments regarding Hisui’s growth. The only one not overly excited was Lieseleta of all people, who silently lamented the evolution, already missing the “innocent cuteness” of “baby Hisui”, as she put it. But she seemed more than pacified when Hisui began to snuggle into her side, nearly making her squee in happiness. It was really kind of adorable how she tried to keep her composure when everyone was already well aware of how she reacted to cute animals.</p><p>But Hisui’s evolution brought with it a far more troublesome problem, namely, Wilfried. Rozemyne could hardly bring a fully grown fetze to her scheduled meeting with him today. The knights guarding the castle would most likely not even allow her entry upon seeing her pet now, so she had to deal with the coming tantrum her “lord” would undoubtedly throw her way instead. She instructed Hisui to remain at home for her trip to the castle, meaning that Rozemyne was on her own as she mounted her highbeast. As expected, she earned many curious looks, arriving at the castle unaccompanied. Even Oswald addressed her lack of a furry companion as soon as she entered Wilfried’s new chambers in the north wing.</p><p>“I see that you have not brought your pet today, Niece.”</p><p>His powers of observation were truly too remarkable to be commented upon.</p><p>“Indeed, Uncle. There was an accident, which resulted in-”</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>Their conversation was rudely interrupted by Wilfried’s sudden entrance. She glanced at Oswald for a second, who seemed really uncomfortable, as he should be. Wilfried <em> still </em> became overly excited when she appeared to give him his music lessons, and did not even attempt to hide his feelings. He was not even giving her a chance to greet him as would be expected from someone of her current station. Rozemyne had already berated her uncle enough about the entire entourage failing to educate their charge, she would not waste more of her time on them. She would have to simply stand back and let it run its course until some improvement magically happened, or, more likely, Wilfried made one too many mistakes. There was no need for her to interfere, it would play nicely into her whole future rhetoric after all. So, she simply bowed politely with her arms crossed. It would not do for her to pick up bad habits from this unmannered child.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Wilfried. Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together once again. Despite this joyful reunion, I feel obligated to inform you that my Hisui has undergone some changes that require those in the heavens to pass their judgement before any more interactions are possible. My deepest apologies. May we proceed to your lessons regardless?”</p><p>“So you have not brought her? What happened?”</p><p>Rozemyne rose from her bow, switching into her trusted Angelica pose, doing her best to appear troubled.</p><p>“My dear Hisui was overly blessed by Schlagziel, resulting in her evolution. She has grown up in size and power, making the topic of further interaction with her more… delicate in nature than before. There is understandably a difference between a small, trained zantze and a fully grown fetze, even if she’s still tame…”</p><p>“So she has grown up? That sounds awesome! If she is still listening to you as before, I do not see the problem. Bring her here!”</p><p>She took a few seconds to glance around the room. Everyone listening had gone slightly pale, staring at her uncomfortably. Oswald and Lamprecht, who stood behind Wilfried, were both openly grimacing at their lord's answer.</p><p>“My Lord, if I may interject. Rozemyne is more than correct in her assumption – you would have to speak with either Lady Veronica or your father before interacting with such a dangerous feybeast.”</p><p>“You may not be aware of how much of a difference evolution has on feybeasts, my Lord. If Hisui grew up, she would have at least tripled in size. We are not speaking about a small little pet, but a predator capable of seriously wounding fully trained knights like myself. The risk is much too high!”</p><p>She kept up her distressed facade, but the fact that Oswald had mentioned Veronica before Sylvester was an obvious clue of where his loyalties lay, not that Wilfried would pick up on it. Even if someone would inform him of his retainer's loyalties, he would most likely simply accept them regardless.</p><p>‘As if his dear Grandmother could do anything wrong. It is equal parts fascinating and disturbing to see how far that woman has sunk her claws into him. It is no wonder he was never able to escape her shadow.’</p><p>Wilfried openly pouted before taking on the demanding tone of a spoiled child as he lectured Lamprecht and Oswald for worrying about his safety.</p><p>“Rozemyne said Hisui is still tame, and it is going to be Rozemyne’s job to protect me anyways. Lamprecht, you should listen to her if she says Hisui obeys her. And anyway, I want to see her! I said I want to, so you should do it! Grandmother would not say no to me. It’s your job to get me what I want, Oswald, and I want to see her now!”</p><p>Everyone stared at Wilfried in disbelief, especially Lamprecht. Oswald, to his dis-credit, only looked resigned. As nobody was stopping the little tyrant’s tantrum, he turned to her with a clear order she couldn’t refuse.</p><p>“Rozemyne, return home and come back with Hisui. I will not have my lesson without her.”</p><p>Why was he always troubling those around him with such ridiculous orders?! It was perhaps a bit hypocritical coming from her, but not even she would go around ordering things that could potentially endanger her retinue, <em> especially </em> after she was informed of the dangers!</p><p>“But my Lord, even if I left now, we would not have time for your lesson after my return. It would take at least a quarter of a bell to travel to my parents’ estate and back, potentially longer if I get held up by the castle guards. Dregarnuhr will not stop her weaving for mortal desires. We could simply wait until those residing in the-”</p><p>“We just have to change my schedule then! Lamprecht will escort you and await your return to bring both of you back here, then the guards won’t bother you. This is an order!”</p><p>She reluctantly bowed to mask her grimace. Even her finely tuned control was slipping a bit at the sheer ridiculousness of dealing with this childish tantrum.</p><p>“As you command, Lord Wilfried.”</p><p>After her dismissal she left the chamber, followed by Lamprecht. Both of them kept their silence until they had left the north wing.</p><p>“I apologize for the trouble, Lamprecht. Could you send an Ordonnanz to your father while I fetch my pet? It would greatly relieve me to not be the reason all of us get reprimanded for ‘endangering’ Lord Wilfried without permission…”</p><p>“There is no need to apologize. It is just another example of our young lord struggling to heed Anhaltung’s advice. As much as I do not want to badmouth him, endangering the lives of those who are serving him like this is a bit…”</p><p>She did not answer, simply moving on ahead instead of waiting as Lamprecht used an Ordannanz to inform Karstedt. She could only hope the fallout would not disrupt her plans. Why was dealing with Wilfried such a minefield?!</p><p>Her sudden return home left everyone confused, even more so when she told Mathilde a shortened version of what happened. Her retainers were… not amused at all. But Hisui at least seemed happy on her way back to the castle, cuddling her head into her side as both of them flew on Nyx. She just hoped they would manage to calm her mother down when she was unavoidably informed.</p><p>Upon her arrival she was greeted by Lamprecht and two additional knights – already with weapons at the ready, just as she had suspected. He directed her to follow him to a meeting room instead of going directly to Wilfried’s chambers. Aub’s orders, apparently. Great.</p><p>The knights came threateningly close to them both, making Hisui snarl at them.</p><p>“I would greatly appreciate a bit more delicacy when handling the matter of my companion. One need not be a feybeast to feel agitation when their master is openly threatened like this.”</p><p>They only flinched slightly at her stern reprimand, but did ease up a bit as they continued on their way. It took them just a few minutes until they arrived at their destination, a guard announcing their arrival before ushering them inside.</p><p>Inside the room were a few additional knights, including Karstedt and even Sylvester, who eyed her from his seat with his Aub-face. She moved into the center of the room, crossing her arms and kneeling down with as much grace as possible while Hisui stuck close to her protectively.</p><p>“Karstedt informed me about your pet's growth, and that my son requested its presence for those lessons you are providing. I would think that you would not humor such a notion, young Rozemyne. But I am willing to hear your thoughts on the matter.”</p><p>So he decided to even forgo greetings? The usual jump to conclusions was somewhat expected, even if it was annoying to deal with. She looked up from her bow, giving Sylvester her best lady’s smile.</p><p>“I thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing Ordoschnelli to carry my voice to you over those stray melodies which unfortunately appear to have been soured by the many birds who carried them, Aub Ehrenfest. Rest assured that I have acted as nothing but a faithful pillar in the wake of <em> Gebordnung</em>.”</p><p>Sylvester's eyes narrowed slightly, glancing behind her, most likely at Lamprecht.</p><p>“I trust that melodies have been carried to the one wearing the dark cloak of how all the pillars had acted under the guidance of Anhaltung to be our lord’s Schutzaria. We have, of course, advised that the creatures of Schlagziel’s domain may carry Chaocipher’s influence, and requested permission from those who rule the heavens first. Sadly, as a mere pillar, I cannot be Flutrane once Gebordnung’s name is evoked. Regardless, I apologize for any trials of Glucklitat resulting from my actions.”</p><p>“Ordoschnelli did not deem it necessary to sing such a long melody for me. I see some details have been missed.”</p><p>Sylvester looked as if he wanted to hold his head in exasperation. Sadly, that was not possible in such an open setting.</p><p>“Can you guarantee that your pet is still well behaved?”</p><p>“But of course, Aub. Would you allow me to demonstrate?”</p><p>She received a nod, so she directed Hisui closer, first giving a couple of basic instructions to sit, lay down, roll and stand again. Then, she ordered the fetze to open her maw and keep it open, placing her hand on top of the sharp teeth. Hisui did not move a single muscle or take her eyes off of her owner’s face until she was given the release command. Finally, Rozemyne took a small feystone from her pouch, filled it with mana, and held it out in front of her.</p><p>“Hisui, hold.”</p><p>The feybeast carefully took it in her mouth, as gently as if she was holding an egg. Satisfied, Rozemyne nodded and turned back to Sylvester, leaving Hisui to patiently sit by her side with the tempting feystone held delicately between her teeth.</p><p>“My Hisui follows my commands flawlessly, as you can see.”</p><p>“Hm, very well. She does seem tame enough to not be a risk we can’t deal with. I will allow it for now, but should she cause any issues, Verdraeos shall not punish you lightly.”</p><p>At least that bothersome interaction was done with. Rozemyne finally removed the feystone from Hisui’s mouth and petted her furry companion for a job well done. Just as she was preparing to be dismissed, Sylvester’s voice called out.</p><p>“Everyone except Karstedt and Rozemyne, out.”</p><p>It seemed the surprises just kept on coming…</p><p>“Hisui, be a good girl and follow Lamprecht until my return.”</p><p>“Mreow.”</p><p>She remained standing in front of Sylvester as everyone filtered out of the room, somehow managing to keep her composure as she saw Lamprecht's face when Hisui stuck close to him. A sound-blocking barrier was erected as soon as the door closed, before Sylvester’s shoulders slumped slightly, and he let out a quiet but audible sigh. She had not expected to still be present when Sylvester let part of his stern persona drop. It was… unsettling… to be allowed to witness even such a miniscule moment of weakness as a mere archnoble. Rozemyne’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Where did such sudden trust come from? She was not the young commoner girl he could exploit to his heart's content anymore, nor the adopted daughter that was expected to fix all of his problems. Technically, he could still order her around, but it would be better for him to treat her for what she had now become – a merciless noble, willing to exploit him at every possible opportunity. Was it perhaps some agenda to manipulate her? A play on her supposed inexperience by making her feel sorry for him? Was she about to be roped into his problems again?</p><p>“I beg your pardon, Aub? Should I not leave as well?”</p><p>“No, there is actually something we need to speak about. Sit.”</p><p>Rozemyne obeyed the command, sitting down opposite from Sylvester, who now tried to pin her with a somewhat angry look. She only held her polite smile, making him obviously uneasy as the silence began to stretch. He began to look between her eyes after a while, one of his bad habits when he felt somewhat nervous. She nearly raised her eyebrow in surprise. Was he… <em> wary </em> of her?</p><p>“I am aware you are reporting about my son's progress to my mother.”</p><p>“Ah yes, of course. It is thanks to Lady Veronica that I find myself in the position of Erwachlehren to Lord Wilfried in the domain of Kunstzeal, as you ordered, Lord Sylverster. I must of course report the progress of my pupil to the one providing me with Greifechan’s blessings for my effort, no? Currently I am simply fulfilling my role as Erwachlehren, as I will only become Leidenschaft after his debut. As my dealings with Gebordnung did not specify otherwise, I thought the duty of reporting his progress was fulfilled by reporting to his <em> Wiegenmilch</em>. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, seeing that I am still only beginning to step into my summer myself.”</p><p>He flinched at the mention of who Wilfried’s baptismal mother was, followed by a twitch of his left eyebrow. Was he searching for some reason to punish her? That was a poor attempt in any case, but… Why show such open emotions now?</p><p>“You are fulfilling your duties just fine, that was not a reprimand. I have read your reports, but I would like to hear your opinion about Wilfried’s ongoing education directly <em> from </em>you.”</p><p>‘I do not like where this is going at all…’</p><p>“I beg your pardon, Aub. Grammaratur seems to have tangled our threads. I was assured that those reports were sufficient by Lady Veronica herself. Was there something specific you seek confirmation on?”</p><p>It was somewhat entertaining to watch him try to hold onto his Aub-persona, whilst struggling fiercely with his worries as a father. Too bad he was a failure in both roles. </p><p>“What are your honest thoughts about Wilfried’s current… abilities?”</p><p>“Lord Wilfried will most likely never enjoy playing the harspiel, as I have written in my report, but I believe that he will be more than passable for-”</p><p>Sylvester raised his hand, making her stop in her latest attempt to evade his true question.</p><p>“I am sure you are aware of what I am asking. I would appreciate you not stalling any further.”</p><p>“…I could not possibly comprehend the skills it takes for one to grow into the dark cloak.”</p><p>She did not like the sight of his cocky smirk at all.</p><p>“Ah, but as a mere pillar, you cannot be Flutrane once Gebordnung is evoked, right?”</p><p>Rozemyne chose to keep her silence, letting it speak instead of possibly fumbling this dangerous situation with words.</p><p>“That bad?”</p><p>At least he lost his superior attitude, looking more resigned than amused at her.</p><p>“Do not misunderstand me, young lady. I will not punish you for stating your opinion openly to me. So far your report has been the only melody Ordoschnelli brought to me that has not been sweetened for my ears… And, as pleasing as the sweet melodies have been, they have not exactly carried Anhaltung’s blessing with them. So, Rozemyne, please tell me your honest opinion about my son.”</p><p>“…I am Erwachlehren in the domain of Kunstzeal alone, the other domains are beyond my reach. I have not even witnessed any of his other lessons aside from my own. I can only give you a very biased opinion based on my observations of his dance with Grammaratur and his manners at the crossing and parting of threads in Dregarnuhr’s hands. You may not like hearing my words, Aub.”</p><p>He simply waved his hand, urging her to elaborate. She took a moment to gather her thoughts. She dearly wanted a warm cup of Tuuliane’s tea right about now. Why was dealing with this archducal family so headache-inducing?</p><p>“Lord Wilfried will be able to successfully debut in the coming winter, as I stated before. As for my opinion on the rest… he is failing in even the simplest points of noble etiquette. Any somewhat competent <em> mednoble </em> will overwhelm him in a prolonged discussion using noble language. I worry about what someone trained in the art of Grammaratur, on the level of archnobles, could do to him. I have mentioned my first assessment to my future colleagues, but so far have seen very little improvement in his manners. Should he not… better himself, you may be forced to demote him before he even enters the Royal Academy and causes unpredictable amounts of problems for Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“…You have truly spent too much time with my brother in the temple, both of you are so cold in your analysis. But it is concerning that even a little girl would assess him with such damning words.”</p><p>What did he expect? The time for her to openly show pity was long gone. Ferdinand was not wrong in his first impression of ‘that fool’ at all. He was a ticking time bomb in the making, especially now that she was unwilling to prop him up any more.</p><p>“As you have asked for my honest assessment, please forgive my crude words, Aub. Lord Wilfried is an archduke candidate, and your heir apparent. It is not unreasonable to expect him to be above my own meager abilities. It is deeply troubling to know that most of the <em> grays </em> in the temple demonstrated better bearing and a greater understanding of noble language. When I first met your son, he was… brash, unable to understand most of the words I spoke to him. He did not even understand a simple greeting, nor its supposed order or the words expected. He has openly shown defiance to your orders to appoint me for my future position…”</p><p>Sylvester paled slightly, his eyes widening at the implications.</p><p>“He accepted it when it was explained to him properly, so I would hazard a guess that he was simply not sufficiently educated on this topic. He has since bettered himself a little, but begins to struggle in understanding my words as soon as I use slightly more advanced phrases. Mind you, not more advanced than what a pre-academy child should know. I am forced to speak plainly with him so he can understand what I am telling him. The only saving grace is the fact that he genuinely tries to understand me, but that is hardly praiseworthy at his age. With all due respect, Lord Sylvester, even in the most ideal scenario Leisegang nobles will look down on him at the very least, but more likely they will exploit him, and quite easily too, if this is not prevented by open interference from the heavens. I do not have any experience of the academy, but would harbor a guess that his standing will not protect him much from such easily exploitable flaws among higher-ranked duchies.” </p><p>“So… he shows interest when talking with you? Maybe you could teach him a little bit more, if encouragement is all that is necessary to guide him onto the correct path?”</p><p>She let her smile drop, changing her expression to show distress at his words.</p><p>“Oh my. Am I to understand that I should fulfill not just the role of Lord Wilfried’s Leidenschaft, but as Erwachlehren and even Wiegenmilch? A young sprout like myself would never even dare to assume to usurp the privilege of the Supreme Couple. I fear such a weight could prove to be much too heavy for my young shoulders. Also… Is there not a clear difference between the expected manners of a Lord and a Lady? I could not bear my future Lord to be ridiculed for acting with the manners of a lady due to my teachings. I am afraid I simply <em> could not do </em> what you were about to suggest, Aub Ehrenfest. Should it not be his chosen pillars who educate him in their respective roles? It would be best for the reputation of both my future Lord and my colleagues among the rest of the nobility.”</p><p>Sylvester looked at her with a guarded expression now, but even he seemed aware that he had overreached with such a silly notion; asking <em> her </em> to fix Wilfried for him. <em> Again</em>. She was just his knight, not his <em> parent! </em></p><p>“If I may be so bold as to use your earlier words. Would asking Lord Ferdinand to educate him not solve all of those issues? I experienced his skill as Erwachlehren to those requesting education or even being assigned to him first hand. I am sure Lord Wilfried would flourish under his careful guidance.”</p><p>“That is… not an option.”</p><p>Sylvester’s dismissal of her suggestion resulted in an uncomfortable silence forming between them. He had most likely already tried and received a clear no from his brother.</p><p>“It appears our threads are tangled. Let us disperse with Grammaratur’s dance, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“…As you wish, Aub.”</p><p>She crossed her arms, bowing slightly to him in her seat in deference. But on the inside, she was beginning to seethe. She would <em> not </em> allow herself to be exploited. Making sure her usual polite smile was firmly in place, she raised her head to look at Sylvester again, leaving no room for any of her internal thoughts to shine through. It was even a bit pitiful that Sylvester’s stern glare was unable to make her feel anything besides indifference. She wondered what his thoughts were upon seeing his persona fail to intimidate a small little girl.</p><p>“I would request similar reports about my son’s progress be given to me regularly. Not just about music, but your judgement on how he would be received by the nobility with his skills and manners.”</p><p>So he wanted her to <em> spy </em> for him? On his own son? She was aware that retainers assigned to their children by their parents fulfilled a similar role, but why was he trying to recruit <em> her </em>for such a position? She was neither experienced nor loyal to him at all. For all he knew, she was only a willing pawn for Veronica. </p><p>Before her silence could be taken as agreement, she tilted her head slightly and willed her face to take on a concerned look, just on the edge of confusion, and blinked at him owlishly. His Aub-persona continued to crack with greater and greater speed.</p><p>“I do not expect for you to toil without benefits, of course. Your work will receive ample rewards.”</p><p>So he was even willing to bribe her?</p><p>“You would offer me a reward for giving you updates about your son? My, I am unsure why you would come to me with such an… honor. Are there not enough retainers assigned to my future lord, fulfilling this very same role?”</p><p>Sylvester leaned back in his seat, looking at the ceiling while sighing quietly.</p><p>“They are reporting to my Mother. As I am sure you are fully aware of.”</p><p>He was steering the conversation into a quite politically loaded area now. Something much too dangerous for a young archnoble daughter to be dragged into. It would surely be terrifying for any ordinary noble. Better feign ignorance than make herself look too competent.</p><p>“I fail to see the problem then, Aub? Is it not normal for them to report to his Wiegenmilch? You told me you read my earlier reports, meaning you have seen the same on his other progress as well, correct?”</p><p>“…Curious you would say so.”</p><p>He looked at her again, the short time inspecting the ceiling had apparently helped him repair the cracks in his mask. He smiled at her with that superior attitude again, before making a grandiose move with his hand.</p><p>“Do you think I am not informed of how my mother <em> convinced </em> you to take your current position? I am more than aware of how your family was treated by our faction before your entrance into noble society. And how you are treated now.”</p><p>She smiled brightly at him, making him lose his smirk.</p><p>“It is an honor to serve the archducal family, there is no need to think that I was <em> convinced </em> of anything. It appears Ordoschnelli has mayhaps carried mischievous melodies tainted by Chaocipher to your ears, Aub Ehrenfest. I can also not help but remember that it was <em> you </em> who granted me the very same honor. Lady Veronica just promised to <em> recommend </em> me.”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her answer. She had not denied his argument after all, she had just pointed out that he was successfully manipulated into taking the blame for Veronica’s actions against her.</p><p>“I can guarantee you that my sources are most trustworthy, young Rozemyne.”</p><p>Hm, so the information did not come through a Veronican. Who, then… Ah, Leberecht. It appeared he had asked Florencia for help as well. How bothersome. She glanced at Karstedt, who was watching her with his usual blank expression.</p><p>“Would Lord Lamprecht not be a better choice then? He is part of your Ordoschnelli's faction as well.”</p><p>It was somewhat satisfying to see both of their eyes widen just a tad. Had they truly expected her to not understand where he was getting his information from? Karstedt gnashed his teeth together, barely preventing himself from speaking. Curious. She looked back at Sylvester, noticing a small drop of sweat on his forehead.</p><p>“I… Lamprecht has failed to inform me of such issues as well. The list of possible sources for reports is… not as expansive as I would prefer.”</p><p>So he had realized his position as the mere figurehead of the Veronica faction? Come to think of it, he was awfully quick in throwing Veronica into the White Tower in the last weave. Maybe her previous circumstances and adoption by him had only accelerated an already established plan? Was he already in the process of trying to escape his mother’s shadow? It was kind of amusing to see her still being the linchpin of Veronica’s banishment to prison, even if it was on the other side of the spectrum this time. She was pretty sure that her assasination of Bezewanst and gifting rinsham to Veronica had derailed their plans by a lot. Now that she thought about it, was there even anyone among his retainers loyal to Sylvester himself, aside from Karstedt?</p><p>“How distressing. I could never assume how much of a burden those in the heavens have to bear, with managing the nuances of opposing factions. It is humbling to see your mastery of gaining such deep insights from one of Lady Florencia's scholars.”</p><p>Sylvester flinched at her answer. It was part amusing and part… saddening to see his Aub-mask nearly crumble like this under her barrage. She realized that she had arrived at a crossroad of sorts. Was she willing to help Sylvester? After all he did to exploit and use her for his own benefit? It was… surprising, and in the same vein not, that she couldn't truly feel it in her to resent him for his actions. He was a noble, of course he would try to exploit everyone around him as much as possible. He could have done much worse to her, considering his position. And she was now used to doing the very same. But it was only right that she would return the favor at least <em> somewhat</em>. She was in no position to exploit him, but she could <em> fleece </em> him all the same.</p><p>She took her time inspecting his expression, how his eyes shifted nervously. Beads of sweat were clearly visible on his forehead. Blasted Gods above, had she derailed him to this degree? It was as if their roles were reversed.</p><p>“Pardon me, Aub Ehrenfest, but you never specified as to why you would seek to recruit me for such a duty. Nor did you specify the extent of my ‘reward’ you intended to compensate me with.”</p><p>“…How about free access to the castle book room? I was informed that you enjoy Mestionora’s treasures.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s recommendation, most likely. She also noticed that he had avoided answering her first question. She nearly wanted to rub her hands in glee, but refrained. It seemed that she was his <em> only </em> choice currently. How fortunate! She made a show of looking contemplative, before shaking her head.</p><p>“Seeing as I will be most busy guarding Lord Wilfried, I fail to see what I could gain from being allowed in such a prestigious place. I would have no opportunity to immerse myself in those treasures unless I slack in my duty.”</p><p>He looked at her blankly. Right, she forgot he was not used to the practice of haggling in this weave.</p><p>“How about… lending you a book each year, then?”</p><p>“Reports are delivered weekly, Aub Ehrenfest. Or would you prefer seasonally?”</p><p>He looked as if he had bit into something sour. Did he truly expect that she would be swindled so easily? A book per week was horrifically expensive for a few reports, but it was obvious that he had no one else to turn to for what he wanted. Her services would <em> not </em> come cheap. At this point, he had only one real option if he wanted her service.</p><p>“Seasonally… should suffice.”</p><p>‘Bingo.’</p><p>“As you command, Aub Ehrenfest. I am honored to be of use to you.”</p><p>She bowed to him again, making the silence stretch for a bit, now that they had finished with such a heavy topic.</p><p>“Is there something else I can do for you, Aub Ehrenfest? Lord Wilfried is expecting my return, and I must still provide him the lessons he requires to ensure his success in his upcoming debut - the reason I am here for, since nearly a half a bell ago. May I be excused to fulfill my given duties?”</p><p>He seemed to have somewhat gathered himself, as he looked at her in intrigue now.</p><p>“Just one last question. How did you tame that fetze?”</p><p>He was asking her something random like this <em> now? </em> No, it was Sylvester she was thinking about. He was always easily distracted by anything that took his fancy. She was so glad she had not revealed any food related recipes yet…</p><p>“I stumbled upon a pack of aggressive zantzes on a trip into the noble forest. One of them chose to submit after I had slain the rest, so I spared it for no particular reason. It decided to follow me, and I found her cute enough to make her my pet. After naming her Hisui, I trained and cared for her. Scolding, praising, rewarding. The usual. She evolved just recently, thankfully retaining her mind and remembering who her rightful master is. That is pretty much it.”</p><p>“I see. I expected… more?”</p><p>He looked somewhat disappointed by her short summary. What did he expect? Some grand tale of her taming a Lord of Winter or something similarly ridiculous?</p><p>“Well, let us depart to my son’s chamber then.”</p><p>She nearly lost control of her expression as he stood up. He was going to go there as well? The roguish grin on his face was kind of annoying to look at.</p><p>“All of our schedules are a mess now anyhow, and I want to see how far he has come under your tutelage. So let us depart!”</p><p>She nodded, wordlessly following him as the barrier was deactivated and they left the room. Hisui greeted her with a happy head rub into her side, and both of them simply slotted themselves into the entourage following Sylvester as they made their way to Wilfried’s chambers, even if she was surrounded by wary knights. </p><p>It didn’t take long until they arrived. Heinrich’s eyes widened slightly when he realized who was strolling in his direction, before he opened the door, likely to announce their arrival. It still felt kind of surreal, but she simply had to get used to being part of an entourage like this.</p><p>“Father?”</p><p>Wilfried was not the only one surprised as they stepped into the room. Rozemyne was grateful for her noble training and the many years of experience from the last weave, which allowed her to keep a neutral expression as her eyes landed on Veronica, who was sitting at a small table with Wilfried, leisurely sipping a cup of tea. They were <em> both </em> going to be present at the music lesson?!</p><p>At least Veronica seemed somewhat surprised to see the Aub as well, if her single arched eyebrow was any indication, but she did not comment on the matter at all. It did make Rozemyne feel slightly relieved to know she was not about to be under a planned surprise inspection by Veronica and Sylvester. Instead, she was under an <em> unplanned </em> surprise inspection. Arguably just as bad…</p><p>She moved further into the room as they were in the process of exchanging greetings, stopping just beside Oswald, who eyed Hisui with obvious nervousness.</p><p>It was actually kind of relieving that she did not need to interact with them as the conversation switched to smalltalk. She could just stand here, ignoring Wilfried’s constant glances at either Hisui or herself. This was going to be her life until her plans came to fruition, she might as well get used to it... It could be worse.</p><p>“Can I play with Hisui now? I had to wait the whole morning for it.”</p><p>On the other hand, she should not have even thought about it.</p><p>“Later, son. I came specifically to see your progress with the harspiel for myself. How about you show me what you learned from Rozemyne?”</p><p>Wilfried openly pouted at Sylvester’s words before acquiescing to the demands given to him. He stood up and moved to a chair prepared for him. After he sat down and received his harspiel, he began to play. It was an acceptable performance for an archnoble, though still somewhat subpar to what was expected from someone of his status. But he would at least not embarrass himself anymore. She joined in the polite applause, while he was praised for his efforts.</p><p>“It's all thanks to Rozemyne, she is amazing! You should hear her sing!”</p><p>And now everyone was looking at her again. She simply bowed with her arms crossed, doing her best to keep her annoyance out of her facade.</p><p>“You honor me with your words, Lord Wilfried, but I have to humbly refuse your praise. It is only because of your dedication to learn the intricacies of Kunstzeal’s domain that you have performed this well. May I suggest that you feel proud of your accomplishments instead?”</p><p>Everyone seemed to like her ass-kissing rhetoric. Veronica especially, even giving her a subtle nod of approval.</p><p>“It is as young Rozemyne says, Wilfried. Do not undervalue your own efforts. Even the best teacher can only bring out what is already slumbering deep within. You have obviously worked hard, Grandmother is so very proud of you.”</p><p>At least she was mostly ignored after that oh-so-touching combination of praise and “familial warmth”. Veronica and Sylvester spent nearly half a bell with Wilfried, before their archduke had to excuse himself, citing duties he had to attend to. Veronica was quick to follow, only stopping beside her instead of leaving.</p><p>“There are some matters that will require your attendance at a meeting. It will take place in five days at second-and-a-half bell. I will send a servant to your home with more details later. See that you are available.”</p><p>‘What the hell?! Second and a half bell? That’s not an invitation but a summon. What am I, her retainer?’</p><p>“Of course, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>Bowing to that old hag was becoming tiresome, not that Rozemyne had much choice but to simply smile and accept being treated as if she was part of Veronica’s entourage. Well… not that Wilfried would ever refuse his grandmother should she even deign to ask anyway. She watched with her ever-present smile as Veronica finally left the premises. Now she only had to battle with the fact that Wilfried felt even more unmotivated to play the harspiel…</p><p>At least he did not protest outright when they went over the notes on a sheet of parchment again. To her great surprise, he even began to show a bit of eagerness after a while – staring at the notes with his harspiel in hand and asking her questions. She rose from her seat and moved to stand beside him, pointing out the corresponding notes as she answered his inquiries. From the corner of her eye, Rozemyne noticed that Hisui had stirred from her slumber the moment she stood, surveying the surroundings, and once again raising the tension among the retainers. Pushing the thought aside, she turned her attention back to Wilfried’s questions.</p><p>

</p><p>After their normal lesson was finished, she allowed her charge to play with Hisui for a bit. To her amusement, Hisui seemed to act more regally after her evolution. It was kind of cute to see her trying to imitate her own graceful movements whenever she moved. </p><p>She was only able to leave after nearly a quarter of a bell, the ride on her highbeast doing nothing to quell the slight feeling of unease in her stomach.</p><p>What the hell did Veronica want from her this time?</p>

    <p>“What do you mean the archduke has <em> requested </em> you to report on Lord Wilfried for him?!”</p><p>Roselinde was understandably outraged at the fact that Rozemyne was drafted for yet another duty by a member of their demanding archducal family.</p><p>“There is no need to fret, Mother. It will only mean more scholar work for me. I managed to get a decent deal out of it, honestly.”</p><p>“No amount of reward is worth getting pulled even deeper into the mess that is our archducal family! This is simply an unreasonable amount of work for someone your age!”</p><p>Her father slammed his fist down on the dinner table in his anger, making most of the tableware come precariously close to falling over. It spoke volumes about her mother’s opinions that she did not berate him for such an act at all. Rozemyne herself could only raise an eyebrow at her parents’ reactions. As the future Leidenschaft of Wilfried, there was no way she could avoid being pulled deeper into that cesspit of family drama and politics, at least to a certain extent.</p><p>“I will eventually take up the spear in the protection of Lord Wilfried, being pulled into the corresponding politics of the heavens is only to be expected. No Leidenschaft can sit idly by when Chaocipher’s influence threatens what they swore to protect.”</p><p>There was ultimately nothing they could do regardless of what opinions they had, so getting overly emotional about the expanding exploitation of her talents was just unproductive at this stage. Their priority should lay in casting Verbergen’s shroud over her other innovations and talents, protecting those loyal to her in the process as well. She had to arrange another meeting with Hartmut sooner than she’d expected.</p><p>Her father openly grimaced at her reply, but at least seemed to calm down a little. If only her mother could react similarly. Her distress seemed to grow even more, until her father laid his hand over hers. It was fortunate that all of them were under a sound-blocking barrier, with their attendants facing the wall. They could not be seen or heard openly criticizing the archduke by others after all, regardless of their loyalty. Her parents exchanged meaningful glances, communicating in some wordless language, before a – now calmer – Roselinde addressed her again.</p><p>“What form of compensation are we even talking about, dear? I can not fathom what could possibly move you to agree to such a proposal in the first place…”</p><p>“Books, of course, Mother. Lord Sylvester has agreed to lend me a book from the castle library for every report delivered, which means I get a book each season. I think my efforts in negotiating are worthy of praise!”</p><p>Both of their eyes widened, as she could not resist puffing out her chest a bit at her ability to fleece Sylvester, but annoyingly neither of them praised her for a job well done. Her father even buried his head in his hands while muttering something.</p><p>“Of course it’s books… But the fact that Lord Sylvester is willing to pay you such an absurd reward just for a few reports is even more baffling. Is he not aware of how valuable a book is in comparison? It is concerning that he seems to be truly <em> this </em>desperate…”</p><p>Well, of course he would, those books were not worth much to him. What was wrong about her abusing the fact that he was willing to give her such a treasure merely for giving him some reports? An hour or so of writing on parchment was nothing in comparison to getting those books for herself!</p><p>“Which reminds me that I wanted to inquire whether you know of any capable and trustworthy scholars who would be willing to transcribe those books for me, Mother. I have been told that this is mostly done by laynobles, but I do not know any of them besides Tuuliane and her adoptive family. And my sister is neither a scholar nor a normal laynoble.”</p><p>“…I will have Mathilde give you a list of possible candidates, dear.”</p><p>After that topic was dealt with, they lowered the barrier shortly afterward and resumed their breakfast. Rozemyne had expected to have a leisurely day, until a servant from the castle arrived, presenting her with the details for Veronica’s <em> invitation</em>, if one could even call it that<em>. </em></p><p>She was told to be present in four days. Mathilde’s darkening expression was not giving her any confidence that she would like the contents. After reading through it herself, she understood why.</p><p>The invitation simply stated that she was expected to appear in the castle to give a detailed report on the rinsham industry. It was only thanks to the details Mathilde managed to extract from the servant delivering the summons that Rozemyne found out about Veronica’s aims. Apparently she had been discussing her interest in the production capacity of rinsham and the estimations of profits with her scholars and head attendant. It seemed that the servant overheard quite a bit more than what he said, but was very reluctant to share any more in fear of punishment.</p><p>Typical of Veronica to try to control her ‘opponent’, not giving enough notice for her to prepare with the facts and knowledge to argue whatever orders the trombe might want to throw her way. Or perhaps she was just expecting Rozemyne to be prepared with the information at all times, for whenever she decided to hear it. It was truly like Veronica was not even treating her as Wilfried’s future head knight, but as one of her <em> own scholars. </em></p><p>Veronica was either trying to use and intimidate her, or truly seemed to believe her to be part of her own retinue. The latter was insulting, yes, but maybe even the better of the two scenarios.</p><p>Rozemyne sent word to inquire about the requested details from the merchants posthaste, as she had left managing the industry completely in their hands, focusing more on the noble side of her life for a change. Next she sent Tuuliane to contact their parents, arranging for yet <em> another </em> meeting to discuss things. Said meeting was somewhat fruitless, considering they could not truly anticipate what Veronica wanted at this point in time, but she had to inform them anyway.</p><p>Gustav was quick to give her an update on the current goings-on of her industry, even if he looked paler than usual when meeting her.</p><hr /><p>Dregarnuhr spun with breakneck speed as the days leading up to the summon passed by until she was awoken at first and a half bell. After going through the usual morning preparations and eating a small snack provided by her chefs, she left for the castle, arriving shortly after second bell. She didn’t see anyone aside from a handful of attendants moving about until she reached the entrance to Veronica’s chambers.</p><p>She was led inside a small waiting room, filled with a group of men who she recognized as castle scholars – irrefutable proof of Veronica’s ever present influence, and she could only wonder if they were namesworn to her as well. She was allowed further inside, where she noticed Veronica was still enjoying her breakfast, her female attendants fussing around the place. It was hard to decide which was more inappropriate. Having to stay in a room filled with unknown men as a little girl, or being forced to stand beside the door as if she was a mere guard knight in Veronica’s employ. The only good part of this arrangement was the fact that her blank look seemed to unsettle nearly all of the men when they were finally allowed entry. The fact that she chose to loosely rest her hand on the grip of her mana blade surely only made them more afraid. At least intimidating those fools was a little bit amusing. </p><p>After a few more minutes Veronica ordered the table to be cleared, except for some tea, before she prompted for the reports to begin. It was somewhat annoying that she had no clue where to position herself, but to her great surprise an elderly looking woman approached her as the meeting began in full, speaking to her in a low whisper so as to not interrupt the procedure.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, we understand that all of this is new to you. Would you allow me to guide you to the position Lady Veronica has intended for you?”</p><p>‘…The position that old hag had <em> intended </em> for me?’</p><p>She swallowed her annoyance, simply replying with a polite nod and smile, following the woman as she led her to stand… at the freaking left side of Veronica, beside her <em> head scholar! </em> It was hard to keep her composure, so she plastered her serene lady’s smile on her face, ignoring the implications.</p><p>At least it was not all that boring, the reports dealt mostly with somewhat useful information of the inner workings of the Veronica faction, some of which would be very useful to pressure lower ranked members if she so chose. She was not even surprised when Oswald suddenly joined the meeting as well, handing some boards to the scholars and giving a short report on Wilfried’s educational progress. It was kind of ridiculous that she was allowed to hear all of this stuff directly. Did Veronica not consider her a threat anymore? At all?</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>There was a lull in the talks after Oswald finished his report, making Veronica turn her head in her direction for the first time since she entered. There was the occasional glance, sure, but it seemed that it was now time for her to take center stage.</p><p>“Now, concerning the reports I asked you about, Rozemyne?”</p><p>“I have brought the information about the rinsham industry as you requested, Lady Veronica.”</p><p>She opened the bag at her hip, retrieving the three boards full of notes and presented them to the scholar beside her. He took them to check for poison, before beginning to read after a nod.</p><p>“I have summarised the current production capacity of the existing workshops and provided a rough estimation of profits since their founding until last Fruitday. In addition, I have included an estimation of the projected profits until the coming winter. I do hope that they are to your satisfaction.”</p><p>She glanced at the scholar beside her, whose eyes slightly widened after skimming through them, most likely having reached the profit numbers. It took him only a moment more before he stepped forth and handed them to Veronica, whispering some additional words she was only able to hear by enhancing her ears.</p><p>He spoke mostly about the huge sum of money flowing into her pocket, warning about her growing influence, which was fair. Veronica herself didn’t show any outward reaction except for a single raised eyebrow, simply skimming over the report to most likely confirm the claim.</p><p>“Your estimations of profits do not seem to grow from the previous seasons at all, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“The workshops are producing at their maximal capacity to meet the current demand, Lady Veronica. Any further increase to production would require a considerable amount of upfront investment, which would in fact somewhat reduce the estimations for the next season, not increase them.”</p><p>Her answer did not seem to please Veronica, a subtle frown now on her face.</p><p>“So this industry has reached its limits?”</p><p>“I would not say that, Lady Veronica. But there are some immediate barriers that we would not be able to overcome with the current cost of rinsham and customer market. Workshop space in Ehrenfest city is limited. As it is, my craftsmen already had to compete with dye workshops for buildings to purchase. Taking over any more could make fashionable fabric hard to come by. Not to mention, plant-material is quite limited outside of harvest season. Were I to instruct the merchants to purchase at any cost, the increased price would restrict rinsham to archnobles only.“</p><p>Veronica looked thoughtful at her reply, taking a sip from her tea as the silence in the room continued to stretch.</p><p>“I have no need for a product that would foster resentment in <em> my </em>faction. Dealing with those blasted Leisegangs and Florencia is enough for now. I must say, I am a bit disappointed, Rozemyne. I see your parents have not prepared you sufficiently to oversee a trend such as this. Fear not, I will graciously be your Erwachlehren on this occasion.”</p><p>Veronica did not wait for her answer, so Rozemyne simply bowed her head as a show of gratitude, while the woman carried on in her wise grandmother persona.</p><p>“Trends are fickle, little Rozemyne. Rinsham is popular now since I am spreading it, but you don’t know how long its popularity will last. Making a trend for the heavens to earn our grace is all well and good, but you must be prepared to keep following their whims to keep our favour. I wish to present rinsham for inter-duchy trade. Now, you have been telling me about the problems you are facing, but you are a smart girl, Rozemyne. A smart girl would instead be telling me what needs to happen to make rinsham ready for inter-duchy trade, so I can decide if we have a problem or not. Now, would you like to change your answer?”</p><p>She mentally cursed, making sure her face did not show her dislike of the situation. Veronica’s condescension was the least of her worries. She was most unhappy about being forced to reveal her hand of how easily she could expand this trend and bring in an even greater income both to her own pockets and to Ehrenfest as a whole. She should have known supplying the faction with such a lucrative product would not be enough for the trombe that was sucking Ehrenfest dry of talent. She had hoped to quietly build up her finances and introduce the trend to the rest of the nobility herself at the Academy, to catch the right attention at the right time…</p><p>Now she had to weigh her options, and do it quickly too. She could try to stick to her plan, play dumb and disappoint Veronica by not picking up the honestly very gentle order. If she was acting alone, she might have gone with that option. But now there was her family to consider. She had been playing along with the twisted woman for their sake and her own comfort in the first place. If she agreed to the expansion, the extra income might put her in an even better position of bargaining later on, and she would still have her own secret recipes to prove her worth…</p><p>“I beg your pardon, Lady Veronica, I misspoke.”</p><p>She put on her best innocent look and played along.</p><p>“You are of course much better suited to assess these things than my lowly self. After all, there are other factors beyond my knowledge, like annual reports about the harvests. I have heard rumours that the provinces who are part of the Leisegang faction have seen a sudden increase in their harvests, so the ingredients could be more easily available next year. But I dare not make any assumption based on mere rumors. What I meant to say earlier was that while the merchants report that production in <em> Ehrenfest city </em> has reached its limits, I believe there are other options available.”</p><p>Rozemyne placed her right hand on her cheek, taking her time to appear deep in thought, which seemed to please Veronica as she kept her silence and therefore allowed her to expand her answer this time.</p><p>She presumed “inter-duchy trade” most likely just meant “trade with Ahrensbach”. The current state of Ehrenfest’s harvest could not support such an endeavor at all, especially considering her mana was not spread across the land. She was neither part of the archducal family nor High Bishop, so it made some sense that there was less oil available. Ehrenfest’s breadbasket provinces were all part of the Leisegang faction, which was not recovering from the mana drought as quickly as last time. One of the many reasons why she hadn’t even considered expansion yet.</p><p>It was really kind of strange to her to be thinking about specifics of the industry to find what she could report as fact and what would need to be speculation. She was more used to receiving reports on availability of supplies herself to make decisions and innovate, having to deal with the issue on her own. Most nobles would just simply demand the commoners to obey regardless. The fact that Veronica did not once so far question why she could not simply order them was <em> very </em> surprising to experience. </p><p>“I beg your forgiveness, Lady Veronica, but I am only able to make very rough estimates currently on <em> how much </em> we could expand exactly. The easiest way would be to create workshops in some provinces that are able to produce parts of the recipe in their harvest, to lower the corresponding prices. But without access to the harvest results I simply cannot say which province would be suitable. There would also be the need for additional business-oriented scholars to be assigned to this task, for multiple reasons. Maybe some castle scholars as well, to guarantee everything moves according to your will. I will not bore you with the minute details, but it will require more of Dregarnuhr’s grace to expand on such a scale. If you would allow me another question?”</p><p>“You may ask.”</p><p>“Rinsham has been bound to your faction so far, but I would estimate that for such a rapid expansion there would be a need to involve those unwilling to gather under your banner. May I involve some provinces that took a neutral stance as well, should they prove to have sufficient conditions for the industry?”</p><p>The biggest hindrance to growth was the inability to expand beyond the Veronica faction, so she hoped that Veronica was not as petty as to hinder her because of politics. At least there was no need for additional contracts, gathering those workshops under her thumb by making either Othmar or Gilberta the owners would easily prevent any need for changes. They would balk at the increase in workload at first, but would be pleased at the rising profits and influence it guaranteed them later, she mused.</p><p>“See to it that it is done as quickly as possible, young Rozemyne. I do not care much if you include some of the more unenlightened neutrals in those efforts. You may use whatever you deem necessary for this task, within reason of course. I will arrange a tea party with your mother to go over the final details. Do tell Roselinde to request a meeting from my retainers as soon as the first outline of what is needed is finished.”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Veronica. You honor us with your trust.”</p><p>She crossed her arms and bowed to the trombe. Great, her mother would be a nervous wreck. Again. Well, at least it would guarantee an increase to her fortune at a faster pace, and the additional influence would be nice as well. She eyed the gathering of Veronicans, noticing their stiff smiles. Oh? Seems like not all of them agreed with her opinions on her growing influence. Only Oswald seemed oddly… proud? What a cursed existence she now lived, being related to that incompetent fop.</p><p>Hm, maybe she should get some scholars for herself? Hartmut was good, but she could hardly go around with him openly, and business was not his specialisation in any case. But she could not exactly involve apprentice scholars or even pre-Academy children in this industry without raising some eyebrows. She had to carefully consider who to use.</p><p>The meeting ended shortly after, allowing her to return home for a quick meal and some rest. Even if she had to fly back to the castle to give Wilfried his lesson.</p><hr /><p>After the unexpected expansion of her <em> duties, </em> she decided to blow off some steam. It was somewhat amusing that she was able to acquire what she desired from the lower city again, even as a proper noble. She stared at the small package currently resting in her lap as she sat in her hidden room. Should she be worried that Gustav had not even commented on the fact that such clothes were requested from him again? To be fair, even the last time she hadn’t bought the clothes herself – it was Jenni who organised them being purchased from the cheap second hand store downtown – much to her then head attendant’s dismay. But having sent Delia this time, and Gustav being much better acquainted with her and her staff, it was painfully obvious who and what the clothes were for. Thankfully her hold over Freida also ensured that Gustav behaved very well when it came to keeping her secrets.</p><p>It was actually more of a pain to hide the small package from her mother and attendants honestly. It was very convenient that everyone was busy preparing for the upcoming Hunting Tournament, giving them and Roselinde no free time to enter her hidden room, only coming in to serve her meals or tea when she took refuge here for one reason or another. Rozemyne shook her head. It was not the time to get lost in her thoughts right now.</p><p>She opened the package, laying the contents beside her before standing up from her comfortable bed – a recent addition after her horrible nightmare about the past – before beginning to disrobe. Getting out of her luxurious nightgown by her own was thankfully not that much of a problem, seeing as she had no need to keep her hair in any coherent state. After getting out of it, she placed it on the bed as well. She was about to reach for the feystone on her nightstand, the foundation of her bodysuit, before deciding against it.</p><p>She was unsure if the mana would leak, so maybe it was better to avoid using it. Besides, there were few people capable of actually landing a blow on her, and if she ran into any of them, she would be more worried about being recognised than being hit. Instead she began dressing herself with the clothes she had acquired. The shirt was a bit tighter than expected and bunched uncomfortably at her elbows. It was restricting her movements severely, to the point that she decided to cut the sleeves off just above the elbow with her manablade. It wasn’t like it was a particularly well made item anyway, an unfinished seam wouldn’t stand out very much. The pants also appeared quite a bit shorter than the last pair she acquired from the lower city. Had Anwachs blessed her that much since her last order? They weren’t particularly uncomfortable, but even with her shoes on, a fair bit of skin was visible below the hem. Not exactly appropriate for a lady – but then, wearing pants without an additional layer on top wasn’t considered acceptable in the first place.</p><p>Just like the first time she needed this ensemble, she used a scarf to wrap her hair tightly. She then rolled it up so that her bound hair coiled in a bun at the back of her head, and secured it into place with a long pin, being extra careful not to stab herself.</p><p>The next piece of her gear was her trusted leather holsters strapped around her hip and thighs. She still remembered her attendant’s outraged looks when she had presented it to them at first. But after she proved it was barely visible while wearing it with her knight uniform, they relented somewhat begrudgingly to its usefulness. Her throwing knives found their place in their sheaths on her legs. She did a few stretches and short jumps to get comfortable. Everything was secured firmly, it seemed. Her belt with supplies found its place around her hips as well, and she finished her preparations by throwing the plain, grey colored cloak over her shoulders. The blank mask she had brewed again was firmly secured on her face with some straps.</p><p>She turned around to inspect herself in the mirror, pulling the hood of her cloak over her head. Satisfied that no one would recognize her now, she turned towards the already finished teleportation circle, stepping inside and laying with her face down on the floor as she began to fuel it with mana, whisking her away to her destination.</p><hr /><p>*****Dark stuff starts here*****</p><p>The light of her arrival vanished as she moved out of the circle she had placed on the rooftop of a commoner building. This one in particular was actually quite a lucky find – the wooden roofing of the building had slightly collapsed, creating a small entrance into an empty layer between the outer roof and the rooms below. It was not even high enough to allow crouching, making it a necessity for her to crawl towards the damaged parts to leave. She had widened the gap slightly, by removing a few additional boards, just big enough that she could somewhat enter and exit comfortably. It was not exactly practical for long term use, but at least there was basically no risk of it ever being discovered.</p><p>After escaping the tight space she scanned her surroundings, the cold wind of Ehrenfest’s autumn in the night making her cape flutter as it crept between her layers to caress her body with its unforgiving embrace. Rozemyne slightly cursed the fact she had to forgo wearing the bodysuit now. Standing high up in the cold wind with just a minimal amount of clothing simply just …sucked.</p><p>Doing her best to ignore the developing goosebumps from the freezing air, she started running to the edge of the roof, jumping to its neighbor and closer to her target just a few roofs ahead.</p><p>Using the fact that nearly no one had the tendency to look skywards made it laughably easy to enter the temple grounds undetected, even without being invisible. Now she only had to find some open window, or door, to allow her inside. She had to suppress a laugh when the window she had used for her first exfiltration was still open, serving now for her means to infiltrate the temple.</p><p>How overly convenient and <em> suspicious. </em> She had to hope this was not some sort of elaborate trap, or maybe she was becoming paranoid. It seemed Anwachs had truly smiled upon her, as worming herself through the small open window was a lot more difficult than she remembered. At least it did not seem to be a trap as only silence met her in the abandoned storage room, the light from the moon outside bathing the place in a strangely serene atmosphere. It gave her a bit of time to let her mind wander for just a moment.</p><p>‘Seems that this route will not be usable for much longer. Maybe I should place a circle here too? No… There will be hell to pay should Ferdinand be able to sense its activation and track it down. Well, as long as Anwachs does not get overly eager in blessing my growth, I should still be able to wiggle myself through. Or was it Geduldh in this case who could hamper my entrance?’</p><p>She took a moment to spread her arms to open her coat, inspecting her body in contemplation.</p><p>‘I know it’s not the right moment for this, but having a somewhat normal growth this time around sure makes a remarkable difference to before. Having a perfectly healthy body from the start sure is amazing.’</p><p>She let her arms drop, shaking her head for a moment to dispel the distracting thoughts. She was here to kill one of her first mortal enemies, not to marvel at herself and her developing body. Maybe it was the memories of her association with the temple even after she left it long behind now? The link between the past and the house of the Gods was as annoying to think about as always. Those incompetent fools did not deserve her worship, in the same vein as she did not deserve their overeager blessings. It was a pact of mutual exploitation, nothing more.</p><p>She opened the door, allowing her to advance into the depths of the temple. The corridors inside were as deserted as usual, aside from the occasional rare ‘patrol’ consisting of gray priests. Her experience and the all-around darkness made it laughably easy to avoid their notice as she made her way in the direction of her target. It was a bit annoying being unable to openly use any blessings, but she simply could not risk leaving even the faintest trace of her mana behind for Ferdinand to find. She was pretty sure that as long as she did not dye any magic items in her mana, he would have a hard time picking up her tracks, but she decided to stay on the side of caution. Who knew what that neat freak could track down if he got<em> really </em> invested. </p><p>At least she could still use enhancement magic. Even in the past weave, Ferdinand was never great at picking up mana signatures of people, and since Damuel wasn’t here and enhancement magic did not leave anything behind to be picked up on, it was a safe choice.</p><p>She arrived before the door she had sought, fortunately with no patrol in sight. She tried to gently open the door, but it was locked as expected. So she took out one of the sturdy throwing-knives she had taken with her, forcing it between the edges of the double doors beside the lock with her enhanced strength. Maybe her enhancement was a bit <em> too </em> effective. She was prepared to pry open a lock the same quality as the type of locks used in noble estates.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>She noticed with alarm that one of the doors began to crack and splinter under the pressure. She quickly redirected her blade to the side, but she could not pull back her strength at the same time fast enough. Her blade slipped through, pushing the doors open as the lock, rather than opening, bent towards the inside of the room, breaking through the cracked wood. She tensed up, listening for the sound of footsteps rushing towards her, but the temple remained silent.</p><p>She stepped into the dark room, carefully avoiding the splinters, fully expecting to face some sort of resistance inside at least – her entry was not of the silent variety after all. But to her surprise, there was no one, no attendant, no guard, nothing. She enhanced her eyes, looking for any trace of the guard who was ‘supposed’ to watch the door, finding him dozing in a chair nearby, seemingly oblivious to her forceful way of entry. She closed the doors – or at least jammed them into the doorframe to make it seem closed without inspection – and took out the cloth she had prepared, dosing it with the liquid from a bottle she had taken with her from her selection of handy concoctions. Making her way behind the sleeping fool she prepared herself before taking him in a chokehold from behind, pressing the cloth on his mouth and nose.</p><p>“Mhmoglsh!”</p><p>The muffled cry of surprise and fear was easily silent enough to go unnoticed as he struggled for a few seconds, before succumbing to the effects of her brewed concoction. This particular combination of mushroom extracts was prepared without any mana, making it unknown to most nobles, or so she hoped. It was similar to the sleeping powder she used before, only with the tendency to paralyze her victims for a few hours as well. Nasty stuff.</p><p>With her first hindrance knocked out until morning, she began binding his wrists and ankles, before heaving him up and placing him atop the comfortable looking couch. She scanned the room once more, checking if her actions had drawn any form of notice, but it was only eerie silence that greeted her. It was too convenient to be true, but so far everything had gone perfectly.</p><p>It was unnerving.</p><p>She turned towards her next target, the servants’ quarters. After softly opening the first door, she was greeted by two simple beds, one of them occupied. She simply placed the cloth on the sleeping priest’s face, deepening his slumber. She waited a few moments before giving him a slap across his face. The fact he did not react told her that she had subdued him as well. She bound him before leaving the room, entering the second, which held another pair of beds, which sadly were not all occupied. She wanted to sigh. The young woman lying on her side made the whole thing unnecessarily difficult. She gently poked her a few times, trying to get her to move, but the action did not have the effect she wanted.</p><p>“Hmm, what issit?”</p><p>The young woman turned around, still half asleep. The light filtering in from outside hit her face, confirming Rozemyne’s suspicion as Lily blinked at her slowly with hazy eyes. That sadly meant more forceful measures were necessary. She threw the cloth on her face before grabbing both of her arms, raising them above her head, and moving her right leg to pin her body to the bed, knee first.</p><p>“Wha?! He-phm!”</p><p>Next she took hold of her wrists with one hand, using her other to press the cloth firmly on her face, focusing on the mouth and nose to make sure she was inhaling the scent, as well as to muffle her panicked screams for help. Lily thrashed in desperation for a few moments, before finally going slack. That was not how she intended it to go, but it was fine as long as she had not been able to see her disguised features. She bound her like the others, leaving the pacified woman behind, now standing before the door to the bedchambers of her target. She gently opened said door, stepping inside and closing it behind her. </p><p>She was greeted with a sight she had somewhat expected, even if it was as distasteful as she had feared. It was a moment that made her lament the enhanced eyesight she currently possessed. The vermin had obviously ‘enjoyed’ the other gray shrine maiden, who was supposed to be on nightwatch, before greeting Schlaftraum. Leaving them in a <em> very </em> compromising position. Had the fool fallen asleep after his release on the forced flower offering?</p><p>How pathetic.</p><p>She moved with purpose. The pretty gray being restrained by her own master was at least somewhat convenient for subduing her completely. She repeated her earlier actions, making sure the cloth covered her mouth as she awoke. Were those girls hyper sensitive to something touching them in their sleep? She pressed the cloth down on her face like with Lily, her trashing managing to awaken her violator, who let out some lustful noises. He was most likely not comprehending that the woman under him was struggling to escape instead of trying to rouse another round of Beischmacht’s dance.</p><p>“Hm, You want more? What a good… Wha?”</p><p>He looked up, halting in his slurring as he stared at her in growing confusion. At least the woman was finally sedated, giving her ample room to turn all of her attention to her main target. She moved a bit to the side, making room to slap him across the face. He was thrown off his latest victim, falling off the bed in a crumbling heap. She discarded the cloth to the floor, moving around the bed, seeing that he was moaning in pain when she arrived. Rozemyne wasted no more time before pushing her knee into his back, restraining his arms before beginning to bind them. It was fortunate he was still somewhat disoriented when she finished. She stood up, taking another fresh piece of cloth – clean this time – from her pouch before kicking him in the side.</p><p>“Arhg. You damn imbecile! Don’t you know who-hmpf!”</p><p>She pushed the cloth into his open mouth, silencing his screams. She slapped him again, making him fall on the ground before taking a step back, giving him some time to recover.</p><p>“Dregarnuhr has spun our threads apart for far, <em> far </em> too long, brother Egmont. I do confess I rushed a little in my preparations, but Verdraos is <em> finally </em> about to pass judgment. I do hope you will enjoy the coming moments as much as I will.”</p><p>He stilled in his struggling, most likely realizing that she was a noble from her little speech. It took a few moments until he sluggishly righted himself, now kneeling awkwardly before her. She took off her mask, delighting in the widening of his eyes as he stared at her with recognition and disbelief. The memory that it was this vermin who had acted in the role of a blue priest for her baptism was still a somewhat bitter pill to swallow. She remembered nearly losing her composure then.</p><p>“I realize you are most likely not aware of what you did to garner such treatment, but it doesn’t matter really. Dregarnuhr may have spun back our threads, causing you to be a non-factor in my life. But I will <em> never forget </em> and I will <em> never forgive </em> you for your heinous <em> actions!” </em></p><p>His confusion seemingly only grew, his eyes widening to epic proportions as she slowly pulled out her knife, smiling at him with the sweetest smile she had. She took a moment to relish in his growing panic, the feeling of fear now permeating the air. It was a welcome moment to greet the familiar companion. She was robbed of it in the past, but she could finally go through with her first thoughts when seeing the demolished temple library.</p><p>“You are not aware of how much I have waited to hold a bloody carnival with you, my <em> dear </em> Egmont.”</p><p>She stepped closer, watching with growing joy as he tried to escape her by moving backwards, stumbling in his hasty retreat and falling on his back. She stepped above him, crouching slightly and burying her blade halfway in his shoulder with a single strike.</p><p>“HMMMMMMMPF!”</p><p>His muffled cries reaching her ears were like a sweet melody, played by Kunstzeal herself. Rozemyne let go of the weapon, now standing upright above him.</p><p>“Your deeds of sullying my first sanctuary will now receive their due punishment.”</p><p>She shrugged off her cape, letting it slide to the side on the bed, before stepping on the pommel of her blade driving it deeper into his body in a slow, but deliberate move. Egmont shuddered in agony, convulsing slightly as tears left his eyes. She gave him a moment to gather himself, his eyes staring at her with an odd mixture of terror, shifting into… lust? Her smile dropped slightly, he could not be serious…</p><p>“Are you so lost in Beischmacht’s domain that you would even look at me with Brennwarme influence in your eyes? Do you relish in the rightful smiting? You are truly lost in your own perversions it seems.”</p><p>She glanced downwards, seeing that his sword was beginning to rise. Was this degenerate truly getting a hard on by being restrained and <em> tortured? </em> She looked at his face, seeing his eyes were greedily eyeing her body, alternating between her chest, exposed forearms and the gap between her pants and boots. She was aware that those clothes were somewhat on the inappropriate and… tighter… side, but she was just a little girl!</p><p>The thought actually made her pause for a moment. Had this freak laid his filthy hands on his attendants even before their coming-of-age? What use was it to torture this scum for all of his deeds if he <em> relished </em> in it? That fool was most likely thinking her actions were some sort of sick sex-play or something.</p><p>She pulled another knife from the strap on her leg, watching in disgust as his eyes flicked to it momentarily before focusing on her chest in glee again, before changing target and straining his neck to glimpse for even the slightest flash of her bare skin. He was basically violating her with his eyes alone! This was… just disgusting.</p><p>“…I congratulate you, Egmont. I am truly bereft of Grammaratur’s blessing about the depths of your depravity.”</p><p>She leaned down, placing her blade at his throat before beginning to use her small dagger like a saw, the erupting blood sprayed on her face. It was the only way any fluids from him would <em> ever </em> be allowed to touch her. She could at least enjoy his last moments a little bit as he convulsed and began to drown in his own blood, but this was not at all what she had expected. Why did this freak have to be disgusting even in his dying moments? It took all the fun out of it! She continued to slice into his neck, easily separating his windpipe, followed by his spine. After a few more moments, she had finished separating his head, rising again from the now still body as it bled all over the cheap carpet.</p><p>She glanced around a bit before spying a standing candle-holder suiting her needs. She smashed the top and foot off, ramming the pole into the bed. She then slammed the head of her victim on the pole until the spike pierced the whole brain. It was maybe a bit crude, but would do for finishing her bloody carnival.</p><p>She then moved to the girl she left earlier, binding her securely. She wiped her feet off at a clean part of the carpet, making sure every previous bloody footprint was smeared into an unrecognizable mess. She then retrieved the small cloths, blades and cape, securing them in their previous places and throwing the cape around her shoulders to cover her again. As her last move she hauled the naked body of the girl over her shoulder, leaving the room and depositing her on the free bed in her chamber.</p><p>After making sure there was nobody outside, she left the scene of her crime, making her way back to the point she had entered. What an absolute waste of an excursion!</p><p>*****Dark stuff over*****</p><hr /><p>Over the coming days, she made sure not to even be within hearing distance of any investigations the Knight’s Order may have been doing, and instead threw herself into her busy schedule. Seeing as Schutzaria had fully raised her shield, it was time for the Hunting Tournament to commence, which would be a novelty for her. Rozemyne had never actually participated in one, being far too busy with preparations for the Harvest Festival or other things far more worthy of her attention. It was honestly more than just a little bit exciting after her revenge on that book fiend had turned out to be a complete disaster, robbing her of her rightful chance to release some much needed frustration through simple violence.</p><p>‘…I guess that I have to come to terms with the fact that I have become exceedingly more violent over the years. Who would have thought that I would look <em> forward </em>to bloodshed when I was still this age in the last weave.’</p><p>“Ah, this will be your first Hunting Tournament, Milady. And I will be able to guard you in it as well, maybe even slaying some feybeasts in your name? It will be amazing!”</p><p>She glanced at Angelica, who was openly swooning about the coming events in the usual place beside the door. Rozemyne herself was standing in just her drawers and chemise before the mirror, about to be changed into her own knight outfit by Gretia and Tuuliane. She could see Mathilde shaking her head in resignation, while Lieseleta, who was holding her uniform at the ready, was glaring daggers at her sister.</p><p>They had established a good routine for dressing her in combat-ready attire by now. Once her hair was done, she formed her feystone bodysuit under her chemise, covering herself from neck to toes in the strange skin-tight material. There was honestly no way to describe what it felt like. It was stretchy and moved with her body just like another layer of skin. It was elastic enough that it didn’t uncomfortably press the folds of her drawers into her legs as it covered the delicate fabric. And yet, it was impossible to penetrate with any object that did not contain at least the same amount of mana as Rozemyne herself, making it the perfect final layer of protection against wild feybeasts.</p><p>Next were the layers of her general knight uniform, starting with the pants which were too rare an item in most of her outfits. It of course had to be covered by a dress with a split skirt, and then the outermost layer of her uniform. Finally, her attendants helped her secure her feystone chestplate and gauntlets, making sure they lay smoothly over her clothes after she formed them, and the outfit was complete.</p><p>After finally getting dressed, she had a somewhat uneventful breakfast with her parents, even if watching her father bragging that he would hunt the biggest feybeasts and present them to her mother as signs of his eternal love for her was amusing to watch. As was the fact that her mother could barely suppress her blushing in embarrassment. It was adorable, making even Lieseleta break her normally near unflappable – aside from cute animals – composure as she shared a refined giggle with Gretia behind their raised hands. Mathilde and Tuuliane simply shared knowing grins with the rest of the staff, who wore similar expressions. Her parents’ never ending courting behaviour was really, <em> really </em> romantic after all, which was so very rare in noble society, where marriages almost always focused on politics.</p><p>The rest of the morning flowed similarly, until it was time for all of them to enter their carriages. The trip to the grounds where the massive tea party would be hosted by the archducal family itself was just on the edge of the noble forest, meaning that the ride itself was not very long at all. At least it was long enough for her mother to regain her usual composure when her father finally stopped complimenting her, giving the opportunity for a few questions to pop into her mind.</p><p>“Do I have to hunt together with you as a minor, Father? Or can I simply take Angelica and Hisui with me?”</p><p>“It would normally be expected that you will be accompanied by one or multiple adults, depending on your rank. But honestly there is no rule dictating anything in this regard. It <em> could </em> be taken as a sign of mistreatment or that you have fallen out of favor, but the fact that your prowess is known to all would make me standing beside you in the hunting part just appear… comical at best.”</p><p>He grinned awkwardly at her. The fact that she beat him regularly in their spars clear as day to both of them. To be fair, there was a massive difference between fighting feybeasts and people, but her baseline abilities with enhancement magic were enough to trump every knight in the duchy at this point. Well, besides Bonifatius, who stood in a league of his own. She could have added Ferdinand to the list, but she doubted he could keep pace with either of them, given how he had been neglecting his training since moving to the temple. More mana was not everything in combat after all.</p><p>“So… can I simply take Angelica and Hisui with me without people assuming the worst?”</p><p>She felt the need to repeat her earlier question, receiving a somewhat downtrodden nod from her father.</p><p>“I do confess to feeling an odd combination of joy and sadness at the fact that one of my daughters has already surpassed me. But I am more than proud of you all the same, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She took a moment to bask in his heartfelt pride, and the headpats given very carefully, so as to not dishevel her current hairstyle, were very nice as well.</p><p>“There are actually not that many rules you have to follow. The usage of highbeasts is forbidden to prove your own fitness and abilities, and you have to return by sixth bell, but that is pretty much it.”</p><p>“You mean there are no rules against engaging your fellow contestants in Angriff’s dance? That can’t be right…”</p><p>That was a loophole of massive proportions. Surely you could not just go around killing your competition?</p><p>“There is always the expectation of some deaths, but working against your fellow hunters makes little sense if the goal is to slay feybeasts as prey to present upon your return. I am sure that some past ‘accidents’ were assassinations, covered up by the event, but it is more of a matter of your honor.”</p><p>A bit strange to speak about having honor being a concept for other members of the Veronica faction, but whatever, she simply had to keep an eye open for anyone who would be willing to attack her then.</p><p>They arrived at their destination shortly after their conversation was finished. The carriage pulled up not to the front entrance to the castle as usual, but travelled along its length and came to a stop at the back of the gardens, right at the edge of the noble forest. Nobles from all over Ehrenfest were already disembarking in front of them in a row of carriages, so they had to wait for their turn.</p><p>Rozemyne knew of the existence of this area in the castle gardens, but never had the chance to see it in the past weave, being stuck in the temple – or in her jureve – during these events each time. A winding path hidden between shrubbery led from the castle to this clearing, where the grass was replaced by paving to allow tables to be set up. In the middle stood a large gazebo, with two smaller ones off to each side some distance away. While the first one was somewhat larger and more ornate, they were each only really big enough to seat about four people and leave room for their entourages to do their work around them.</p><p>Two of the gazebos – the main one and one of the smaller ones – were filled with people and surrounded by tables set up all around them on the outside. Rozemyne could see even as she got out of the carriage that many of the tables still stood empty, with servants bustling around bringing hot water for tea to the attendants as the guests arrived.</p><p>As they made their way towards the slowly building crowd, her mother explained that the gazebos were built for the Aub’s wives, long before any of their family could remember, specifically for gatherings such as this one. They were made of the same ivory as all other noble buildings, so they had to have been created with Entwickeln. The main one was built for the Aub and his first wife and either their children or other important members of the archducal clan in the same faction. This is where Florencia <em> should </em> have sat, however it was clear from the Veronican crowd surrounding the gazebo that a certain Chaociper was once again wearing a crown that should have no longer belonged to her…</p><p>Sylvester, seated beside his mother, was throwing longing glances towards his wife in the second gazebo even while wearing his Aub persona. The third gazebo seemed to have been repurposed for the occasion, transformed into a place for the participants of the tournament to be dressed in armour if they did not arrive ready – heavens forbid that one put on an additional layer on top of their clothing <em> in front of the ladies </em>… But it looked like there was also some equipment prepared there in case someone was injured.</p><p>The large tea party was set up quite close to the forest, separated by some low, neatly trimmed hedges with a few gaps between them to allow entrance for the hunters. Interestingly, most of the tables and seats were not set up to face the forest, although they were clustered so that no-one sat with their back to the event. Clearly, while it was an expectation that noble families showed up to cheer for and support the participants, most who were not knights were not that keen on watching feybeasts be slain directly. Being presented with the spoils was enough.</p><p>Rozemyne was drawn back to the present from her musings as she noticed her parents kneeling to greet Sylvester and the rest of the archducal clan, and she smoothly followed right on cue. Curiously, Wilfried was not present in either gazebo.</p><p>Next came the unfortunate but inevitable socialising part of the <em> social </em>event. Just as she stepped out of the second gazebo in the wake of her parents, she was pulled aside by Bonifatius who had been sitting with Florencia.</p><p>“Rozemyne! I am glad to see you came prepared for your first Hunting Tournament!”</p><p>He caught up with them just outside of the gazebo with a few long strides, hopefully after he made some reasonable excuse to leave in the middle of receiving guests. She did not need to give the Florencia faction another reason to dislike her.</p><p>“Indeed, Master! I am looking forward to putting my skills to the test.”</p><p>“Ha! As you should. Sadly, many young apprentice lady knights stay with their family, sipping tea before they start the Academy instead of challenging themselves like you!”</p><p>There were not that many female knights to begin with, but it was true that noble families were more reluctant to let their pre-Academy aged children into a forest of wild feybeasts and armed nobles from all factions, especially when those children were girls. Of course, Bonifatius was likely just thinking that it was a shame they didn’t get to train more.</p><p>“I imagine it would be quite intimidating to participate for those who do not have such a good mentor. I do look forward to witnessing your feats in the wild myself, Master.”</p><p>It wasn’t simple flattery either. She genuinely wanted to see how this beast of a man worked when he had free reign to kill and was not simply training knights he intended to leave alive.</p><p>“Right you are, Rozemyne, right you are. We do not have enough good knights who can take on disciples. Ah, but I will not be participating this time. Do me proud and bring back many spoils in my name!”</p><p>“Ah, what a shame to hear that, Lord Bonifatius. I have enjoyed hunting beside you in the past.”</p><p>Her father looked genuinely disappointed at the reveal, in stark contrast to her mother. Roselinde seemed more than fine to simply move on with the flow of conversation, if the warning glance at her husband was anything to go by, sliding into the conversation before the two men could start to reminisce.</p><p>“My, it seems the feybeasts of the noble forest will be getting off easy this year.” </p><p>“Hahaha! I would not be so sure about that with your daughter on the hunt! Having a disciple participating is my sign to give the young ones trying to prove themselves a fighting chance.”</p><p>A bit demeaning for most other participants, sure, but considering his abilities and experience it was actually quite kind of him to take a step back and allow the younger generations to show off their talents. Rozemyne would have liked for him to take an <em> actual </em> step back too, as he decided to finish his compliment by patting her back a couple of times. She trained her muscles and used enhancement often enough that it truly felt like a pat on the back this time, but she shuddered to think how her old body would have handled the impact.</p><p>“Very generous of you, Master. Do you have any last tips for me before the tournament begins?”</p><p>In hindsight, she should not have asked that.</p><p>“But of course! Come, my disciple, I shall escort you around and tell you how <em> I </em> like to hunt!”</p><p>“Oh, that’s-”</p><p>“My, Lord Bonifatius, I’m sure my little Rozemyne would be grateful for your advice, however we must go and greet our acquaintances now while they are all here. Rozemyne should have known better than to trouble you with such a request. Dear, apologise for your oversight.”</p><p>Her mother interrupted her before she could even try to fix her mistake, but Bonifatius simply waved her off instead, gazing at Rozemyne with barely concealed excitement.</p><p>“Nonsense! You may leave my disciple in my care and converse with the other ladies without a worry, Lady Roselinde. She certainly need not apologise for asking such a trivial thing. Come now, Rozemyne. I remember my own first Hunting Tournament…”</p><p>And so the many anecdotes of old times began as she placed her hand on his extended arm and he escorted her away from her slightly distressed mother and extremely resigned father. The stories he told her about his past were actually very interesting and often quite useful. The only somewhat annoying part was that he insisted on parading her around to the rest of his extended family to show off “his amazing disciple”. It was not at all as demeaning as being strung along by Veronica, his continued praise of her was actually pleasantly embarrassing, honestly. However, this list included the Linkbergs, which made things a bit awkward after their last interaction. Elvira’s subtle promotion of Cornelius’ abilities nearly made her raise an eyebrow, as was his embarrassment of it while he simply looked at her with a forced smile. She did wonder why he stared so much though.</p><p>But honestly the worst part was being introduced to Traugott’s family. They just rubbed her the wrong way as they all continued to smile politely at each other, exchanging meaningless small talk. Traugott’s fixation on her was actually a bit surprising, his eyes practically never left her face. He was being perfectly polite, but she simply had no interest in him at all.</p><p>The whole thing left her just a smidge confused about things. Should they not all abhor her very existence? She was not only a steadfast member of her faction, but Veronica’s favourite little pawn right now. Should they not resent her as members of the Leisegang- Florencia factional alliance? It was weird.</p><p>“Would you be willing to tell me who you are taking with you on your hunt, my disciple?”</p><p>She glanced at Bonifatius after they had gained some distance from his extended family, indicating to the small group following in their trails.</p><p>“But of course, Master. I intend to bring Angelica as my guard, and my pet Hisui with me for the coming hunt. I would hazard a guess that both their experience and abilities will prove most useful.”</p><p>“Do not worry, Lord Bonifatius, I will protect Milady with my life!”</p><p>Angelica’s sudden exclamation drew his attention as he stopped in their walk to turn around and eyeing Angelica with a frown on his face.</p><p>“You think my disciple would need your protection from some measly feybeasts?”</p><p>Rozemyne noticed that Lieseleta paled just a bit, her eyes practically begging her sister to not say anything more stupid.</p><p>“What? Of course not, Lord Bonifatius. Milady is more than capable of slaying any feybeast with nary a scratch! But as her personal guard knight it is my duty to protect her from any threat regardless. They have to prove themselves worthy by going through me first, before being honored to witness Lady Rozemyne’s breathtakingly beautiful dance of Angriff!”</p><p>It was somewhat fascinating to see Lieseleta becoming even more pale, her lip trembling slightly as she held back from smiting Angelica where she stood. Said older sister was currently puffing her chest out proudly after sprouting an inappropriate amount of compliments on her that could be taken very out of context like usual. But she did not expect for Bonifatius to react negatively to those statements at all, considering his tendency to compliment her in a similar, if more restrained, fashion.</p><p>“Ha! Good to see you have such a loyal knight, Rozemyne! This one at least understands things for how they are! Hmm. Maybe I should-”</p><p>“I would beg your pardon for my crude words, Master. But I have to remind you that Angelica <em> belongs to me. </em> That means <em> I alone </em> decide how and what to train her in. I do not mind it when you see potential in her, and offer her some advice, but her education in Angriff’s domain is my burden to deal with. You have become too accustomed to the level we spar regularly at. Most likely you would go overboard, possibly sending my knight up the towering staircase, which I can simply not allow. She is much too useful to be simply thrown away at your whim. Or do I have to remind you of the state Lamprecht was in after you <em> educated </em> him for his recent ‘transgressions’, as you called it?”</p><p>Everyone except Angelica and Mathilde looked at her in shock at the way she addressed Bonifatius, even if it was for completely different reasons.</p><p>“Ah, true. Nevermind then, Rozemyne. But I want to test her mettle after you have finished honing her into a blade able to withstand my attention. Which reminds me that I still need to have a <em> discussion </em> with my son about the state of the Knight’s Order. He is surprisingly elusive when he wants to be.”</p><p>‘Poor Karstedt, but I guess it's his own fault for trying to run away from his father.’</p><p>“I will not be available to heal him after your <em> talk </em>like I did for your grandson, Master. Please consider holding back just a little bit. It would not do for our revered Knight Commander to be out of commission for an extended amount of time. He still needs to protect our archduke in addition to his other duties.”</p><p>“I still do not understand why you healed my grandson after what he said to you at your bout, but I will <em> consider </em> your kind words concerning my son.”</p><p>She simply nodded, making everyone look at her in awe. What? Bonifatius simply preferred it when she spoke frankly with him without reservations. She actually had a much better relationship with him in this weave as his disciple compared to the previous one in which she was his ‘beloved, but frail’ granddaughter. Another plus was that he was not focused on getting Angelica to marry one of his grandsons, leaving her completely in her hands as things should be. Angelica was <em> hers, </em> after all. So evading having them spar together too often was required before he got some strange ideas of playing Liebeskhilfe again. Shortly after that interaction he bade her farewell, leaving her some time for herself.</p><p>“It seems that Dregarnuhr has woven our threads to intersect most beautifully, Lady Rozemyne. May we pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the fruitful days of Schutzaria, the Goddess of Wind?”</p><p>It seemed that she had spoken too soon. She turned to her left where she was greeted by the sight of a bowing Matthias and Laurenz.</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“O’ Schutzaria, Goddess of Wind, may this most fortunate meeting be blessed.”</p><p>After they exchanged the expected greetings and blessings, both of them regarded her with some reservations, keeping their conversation tone low enough to not be easily overheard by those around them.</p><p>“Considering your choice of attire I would hazard a guess that you will participate in the coming hunt as well, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“But of course, Lord Matthias. It will be my first time honoring Schlagziel on this scale. Are either you or Lord Laurenz perhaps willing to part with some advice as fellow disciples in Angriff’s domain?”</p><p>Laurenz was barely able to keep an amused smirk off his face as he answered.</p><p>“There is hardly anything we could part with that is not known to your guard knight as well, my Lady. We are not even apprentices at this point. Please forgive my blunt words, but Wiegenmilch would fume at the seams if both of us are not seen at least <em> attempting </em> to evoke the blessings of a certain Goddess.”</p><p>Oh right, both of them were told by their parents to evoke spring in her heart to bind one of their stars with her own. Not that any of them was on board with this idea at all, which they confessed to at the last ‘tea party’ she had with them.</p><p>“It warms my heart that you wish for <em> Schutzaria </em> to bless me with her divine protection. The concerns your family has for my continued wellbeing are truly touching.”</p><p>Laurenz smirked for a short moment, clearly understanding her deflection and agreeing wholeheartedly. Even Matthias looked more exasperated at the fact that they had to play this game in the first place.</p><p>“Would both of you be amenable to join me in training at the next gathering of the Knight’s Order, Lord Matthias, Lord Laurenz? My master has just informed me that he will be busy discussing some details with Lord Karstedt, most likely making them both unavailable for the occasion.”</p><p>Her offer at least caused Laurenz’s smirk to die an ugly death as both of them looked at her in apprehension, Laurenz glancing nervously at his friend.</p><p>“We are… most grateful for your most generous offer, Lady Rozemyne. But none of us could offer any form of challenge to you. Would it not perhaps be better to challenge Lord Eckhart or Lord Lamprecht again?”</p><p>“Oh my, it seems Grammaratur has played a trick on us, Lord Matthias. I merely meant to offer Dregarnuhr to spin our threads together for an opportunity for Erwachlehren to bless us all. Did Wiegenmilch not dictate for our threads to grow closer? I can think of nothing better than to further our friendship by toiling in Angriff’s domain as fellow knights.”</p><p>She did her best to suppress an evil smile as both of them paled slightly, their postures tense as she left them no room to argue. There was no feeling of spring in the air, but she felt a slight hope of a chance for friendship, and she would be damned if she let this chance to pull them into her service slip through her fingers. The knowledge from the past that they would soon be faced with the choice of who to offer their names to was heavy on her mind. If she guessed correctly, it would be shortly before they got enrolled into the Royal Academy, and she would make damn sure that serving <em> her </em> was more attractive than Georgine.</p><p>“We are honored by your gracious offer, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“It seems we are united in our devotion to Leidenschaft and the kin of Fire. I look forward to our next meeting of their disciples under Schutzaria’s grace. I pray that Dregarnuhr, the Goddess of Time, has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>Both of them gave her stiff bows before departing. Was she maybe a bit too forceful in her approach?</p><p>She did not have much time to ponder the matter as Sylvester called for everyone’s attention with a sound-amplifying magic tool in hand, throwing a short speech before opening the festivities. Most participants rushed into the forest, eager to prove themselves. But Rozemyne merely began to walk at a leisurely pace instead.</p><p>“Angelica, Hisui, with me. I will see the rest of you upon my return.”</p><p>Her other retainers wished her good luck and bade them farewell, making their way to where Roselinde sat comfortably at a table. It was time for the Tournament to start.</p><p>Let the hunt begin.</p>
